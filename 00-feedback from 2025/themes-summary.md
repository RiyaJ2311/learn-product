## Theme 1: Communication Clarity ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

**Frequency:** 5/5 — Mentioned in 4+ feedback sessions
**Impact:** 5/5 — Directly affects stakeholder trust
**Urgency:** 5/5 — "In the last 3-5 threads, did I answer the exact question?"

### Raw Feedback Quotes
> "Answer the exact question being asked, not adjacent ones"

> "When sharing data, translate it into impact/meaning ('so what?'), not just raw numbers"

> "Reduce English and fluff; increase clarity and precision"

### Root Cause
Habit of providing context before the answer, leaving stakeholders to extract the key point themselves.

### Mapped To
- `01-Communication-Clarity/01-Answer-First.md`
- `01-Communication-Clarity/02-Impact-Translation.md`
- `01-Communication-Clarity/03-Self-Grading.md`

### Key Questions
- [ ] Before responding, did I answer the EXACT question first?
- [ ] After sharing data, did I say "This means..." and "So we should..."?
- [ ] Did I grade myself after this communication?

**Status:** Working on it

---

## Theme 2: Data Storytelling ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

**Frequency:** 4/5 — Repeated in PRD reviews and data discussions
**Impact:** 5/5 — "After 6 months of working with data, I don't expect this"
**Urgency:** 5/5 — Blocking PRD approval and strategy credibility

### Raw Feedback Quotes
> "Data is currently too weak and unstructured to support strong product decisions"

> "There is no baseline metric"

> "You open the dashboard and leave it open... you have to cut down the paths"

### Root Cause
Presenting data without narrative, missing upstream/downstream context, no baseline comparisons.

### Mapped To
- `02-Data-Storytelling/01-Data-Triangulation.md`
- `02-Data-Storytelling/02-Baseline-First.md`
- `02-Data-Storytelling/03-Cohort-Analysis.md`

### Key Questions
- [ ] What happened BEFORE this data point (upstream)?
- [ ] What happened AFTER this data point (downstream)?
- [ ] What's the metric ONE LEVEL UP from what I'm looking at?
- [ ] Do I have baseline metrics before writing this doc?

**Status:** Working on it

## Theme 3: Permissionless Execution ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH

**Frequency:** 3/5 — Mentioned in ownership discussions
**Impact:** 4/5 — Affects speed and perceived leadership
**Urgency:** 4/5 — "You should always decide it on your own"

### Raw Feedback Quotes
> "You should always decide it on your own... permissionless for user flow"

> "Waits for validation before acting; hesitates to post publicly"

### Root Cause
Seeking approval for decisions that are within your authority, slowing down execution.

### Mapped To
- `03-Ownership-Execution/01-Permissionless.md`

### Key Questions
- [ ] Am I waiting for permission on something I could decide myself?
- [ ] Can I post this publicly in Slack without asking?
- [ ] What would I do if I was the CEO of this metric?

**Status:** Working on it

---

## Theme 4: Metric Ownership ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH

**Frequency:** 3/5 — Performance review focus area
**Impact:** 5/5 — "Not seen as an owner until you track week over week"
**Urgency:** 4/5 — Q1 focus on retention ownership

### Raw Feedback Quotes
> "Not seen as an 'owner' until you track the metric week over week"

> "Build a weekly dashboard habit, and also do a monthly sanity scan"

> "Catch misalignment early on your own when leadership priorities change"

### Root Cause
Checking metrics when asked rather than proactively tracking and surfacing insights.

### Mapped To
- `03-Ownership-Execution/02-Metric-Ownership.md`
- `03-Ownership-Execution/03-Verification-Habits.md`

### Key Questions
- [ ] Am I tracking this metric weekly, or just when asked?
- [ ] Can I explain the variance in my metric this week vs last?
- [ ] When the goal changed, did I adapt my proposals fast enough?

**Status:** Working on it

## Theme 5: PRD/Doc Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH

**Frequency:** 3/5 — PRD review feedback
**Impact:** 5/5 — "Story is good, but the spine is weak"
**Urgency:** 4/5 — Active PRD work on 0-100 activation

### Raw Feedback Quotes
> "Story is good, but the spine is weak"

> Missing: Activation definition, Controllable vs uncontrollable metrics, Trusted data queries, Clear v1 scope, Guardrails

### Root Cause
Writing narrative-first without rigorous metric definitions and scope clarity.

### Mapped To
- `04-Product-Strategy/03-PRD-Quality.md`

### Key Questions
- [ ] Does this doc have a clear PROBLEM paragraph?
- [ ] Have I separated controllable metrics from track-only metrics?
- [ ] What are the guardrails/risks and how will I treat them?
- [ ] Is my v1 scope CRISP or fuzzy?

**Status:** Working on it

## Theme 6: Outside-In Thinking ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM

**Frequency:** 2/5 — Specific to TikTok slideshow feedback
**Impact:** 4/5 — "Business context was not even clear"
**Urgency:** 3/5 — Important for future projects

### Raw Feedback Quotes
> "Business context was not even clear, didn't know what even was TikTok slideshow"

### Root Cause
Solving problems without fully understanding the customer/market context first.

### Mapped To
- `04-Product-Strategy/02-Outside-In-Thinking.md`

### Key Questions
- [ ] What does my customer actually see/experience today?
- [ ] What are competitors doing in this space?
- [ ] Have I verified this problem exists in the wild, not just in our data?

**Status:** Working on it

---

## Theme 7: Trust & Impact Selling ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM

**Frequency:** 2/5 — Performance review
**Impact:** 4/5 — "You move on from wins without making sure they stick"
**Urgency:** 3/5 — Long-term career growth

### Raw Feedback Quotes
> "You move on from wins without making sure they stick in leadership's mind"

> "Poor impact communication - work like top nav helped, but it didn't get repeated upward"

### Root Cause
Completing work and moving on without ensuring stakeholders remember the impact.

### Mapped To
- `05-Leadership-Trust/02-Impact-Selling.md`

### Key Questions
- [ ] Did I "sell" this impact in the language stakeholders care about?
- [ ] Have I repeated this win upward enough for leadership to remember?

**Status:** Working on it
