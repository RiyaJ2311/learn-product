## Before Any Communication

```
1. What is the ONE thing they need to know? → Say that FIRST
2. "This means..." → Translate to impact
3. "So we should..." → Clear recommendation
```

---

## Before Sharing Data

```
LEFT:  What happened upstream? (acquisition, inputs)
RIGHT: What happened downstream? (retention, revenue)
UP:    What's the metric one level above?

BASELINE: [Current] vs [Baseline] ([Change %])
```

---

## Before Any Meeting

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Answer | What exact question am I answering? |
| Data | Do I have baseline for every number? |
| Action | What's my "so we should"? |

---

## Before Writing a PRD

| Section | Must Have |
|---------|-----------|
| PROBLEM | Who + What pain + Why now + Evidence |
| METRICS | Controllable vs Track-only + Baselines |
| SCOPE | V1 in-scope (numbered) + Out-of-scope |
| GUARDRAILS | 2-3 metrics that must not regress |

---

## Before Making Decisions

```
Can I decide this myself? → If yes, decide
Is it reversible? → If yes, just do it
Is it within my scope? → If yes, own it
```

---

## Daily Lens Questions

| Day | Question |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | "Will I answer the exact question first?" |
| Tue | "Will I say 'This means...' after data?" |
| Wed | "Am I waiting for permission unnecessarily?" |
| Thu | "What's one level up from this metric?" |
| Fri | "Did I sell my impact in stakeholder language?" |

## Emergency Quick Fixes

### About to ramble?
1. Stop
2. Say the ONE thing
3. Ask: "Want more detail?"

### Don't know the answer?
1. "I don't have that now"
2. "My estimate is X"
3. "I'll confirm by [time]"

### About to ask permission?
1. Can I post publicly? → Yes → Do it
2. Is it reversible? → Yes → Do it
3. In my scope? → Yes → Do it

## Impact Selling Template

```
[Win]: What you achieved
[Impact]: Why it matters (in their language)
[Repeat]: 4-6 mentions until it sticks

Week 1: Team Slack
Week 2: Manager 1:1
Week 3: Team meeting
Week 4: Skip-level
Month: Product update
Quarter: Review
```

## Metric Ownership Test

Answer WITHOUT looking at dashboard:

1. Current value? → Know within 5%
2. Last week? → Know the change
3. Why? → Explain the variance
4. Action? → What you're doing

Score: 4/4 = Owner | 2-3 = Tracker | 0-1 = Not owning
