# Module 1: Communication Clarity

## 2-Minute Overview

This module transforms your communication from "data dumps" to "decisive direction." Based on Ian McAllister's framework from Amazon/Uber, you'll learn to answer questions directly, translate data into impact, and build trust through clarity.

**Your Feedback:** "Answer the exact question being asked, not adjacent ones"

**Your Goal:** Every message lands on the first read

## Key Framework: Ian McAllister's Communication Principles

From the Lenny's Podcast episode with Ian McAllister (ex-Amazon, Uber, Airbnb):

### 1. Answer First, Then Explain
> "Don't bury the lead. Start with the answer, then provide context."

### 2. Grade Yourself After Every Communication
> "After every important communication, ask: Did it land? What would I do differently?"

### 3. Trust is the Currency
> "Every unclear communication costs you trust. Every clear one builds it."

---

## Learning Path

### Week 1: Answer First
- Read `01-Answer-First.md` (30 mins)
- Practice the BLUF technique in 3 messages
- Ask a peer for feedback on one communication

### Week 2: Impact Translation
- Read `02-Impact-Translation.md` (45 mins)
- Use the "This means... So we should..." format
- Self-grade 5 communications

### Ongoing: Self-Grading
- Read `03-Self-Grading.md` (30 mins)
- Build the habit of post-communication reflection
- Track your scores in weekly reflections

## Quick Reference: The 3 Questions

Before any communication, ask yourself:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ COMMUNICATION CHECKLIST                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│ 1. ANSWER FIRST                                             │
│    □ What is the ONE thing they need to know?              │
│    □ Is my answer in the first sentence?                   │
│                                                             │
│ 2. IMPACT TRANSLATION                                       │
│    □ Did I say "This means..." after any data?             │
│    □ Did I say "So we should..." with a recommendation?    │
│                                                             │
│ 3. SELF-GRADE                                               │
│    □ Did the message land? (1-5)                           │
│    □ What would I do differently?                          │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Success Metrics

### You've Mastered This When:
- ✅ You naturally lead with the answer
- ✅ Stakeholders rarely ask clarifying questions
- ✅ Your manager notes improvement in communication
- ✅ You catch yourself before rambling

### Warning Signs:
- ⚠️ Stakeholders ask "so what does this mean?"
- ⚠️ Your messages get follow-up questions for clarification
- ⚠️ Meetings run long because of unclear updates
- ⚠️ You notice yourself providing lots of "context" upfront

---

## Module Structure

### 01-Answer-First.md
Ian McAllister's framework: Answer the exact question in the first sentence, then provide context.

**Key Question:** Did I answer the EXACT question first?

Turn data into meaning and action. Always say "This means..." and "So we should..."

**Key Question:** Did I say "This means..." and "So we should..."?

### 03-Self-Grading.md
Build feedback loops by grading your own communications. Did the message land?

**Key Question:** Did the message land? (Self-grade)
