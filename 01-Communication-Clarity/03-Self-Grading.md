# Part 3: Self-Grading Communication

## 2-Minute Summary

**The Problem:** You don't know if your communication landed until much later (or never).

**The Solution:** Build a habit of immediate self-assessment after every important communication.

**The Framework:**
- **Observe** - What was the immediate reaction?
- **Grade** - Score yourself 1-5
- **Adjust** - What would you do differently?

**Quick Test:** Can you grade your last 3 communications right now?

## The Insight

From Ian McAllister (ex-Amazon, Uber, Airbnb) on Lenny's Podcast:

> "Grade yourself after every communication. Did it land? What would you do differently? This continuous improvement mindset applies to everything—every role, every experience, every project, every communication."

**The gap:** Most people move on after communicating without ever assessing whether it worked.

## The Self-Grading Framework

After Every Important Communication:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 30-SECOND SELF-ASSESSMENT                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  1. OBSERVE (5 seconds)                                     │
│     What was the immediate reaction?                       │
│     • Nodding? Questions? Confusion? Pushback?             │
│                                                             │
│  2. GRADE (5 seconds)                                       │
│     Score 1-5:                                              │
│     1 = Completely missed                                  │
│     3 = Mostly understood, some clarification needed       │
│     5 = Landed perfectly, drove immediate action           │
│                                                             │
│  3. ADJUST (20 seconds)                                     │
│     What would you do differently?                         │
│     • Lead with different point?                           │
│     • Add/remove context?                                  │
│     • Use different framing?                               │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## The Grading Scale

### Score: 1 - Completely Missed

**Signs:**
- They asked "what do you mean?"
- Follow-up questions indicate confusion
- They summarized incorrectly
- Visible frustration or disengagement

**Example:** You explained a complex analysis, and they said "Can you just tell me if we should do it or not?"

---

### Score: 2 - Partially Missed

**Signs:**
- They understood part of it
- Required significant clarification
- The conversation went off-track
- They focused on the wrong aspect

**Example:** You presented three options, and they only engaged with the context, not the decision.

---

### Score: 3 - Adequate

**Signs:**
- They understood the main point
- Some clarifying questions, but minor
- Conversation stayed on track
- They could repeat back the key point

**Example:** They said "So you're saying X?" and X was correct.

---

### Score: 4 - Good

**Signs:**
- They immediately engaged with the substance
- No clarifying questions needed
- They asked good follow-up questions (shows understanding)
- Moved toward decision/action

**Example:** They said "Got it. Let's do Option 2. What's the timeline?"

---

### Score: 5 - Perfect

**Signs:**
- Immediate action or decision
- They built on your point
- No friction in understanding
- They referenced it later accurately

**Example:** In a later meeting, they said "As [you] explained, we're seeing X impact, so..."

## Tracking Your Progress

### Daily Tracker (Simple)

Keep a running note each day:

```
Date: ___________

Communication 1: [context]
Score: __ / 5
Adjust: ________________

Communication 2: [context]
Score: __ / 5
Adjust: ________________

Communication 3: [context]
Score: __ / 5
Adjust: ________________

Daily Average: __ / 5
```

---

### Weekly Tracker (Detailed)

```
Week of: ___________

| Day | Communication | Audience | Score | What I'd Change |
|-----|--------------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Mon | PRD update   | Akash    | 3     | Lead with impact |
| Mon | Slack reply  | Team     | 4     | - |
| Tue | Data review  | Puru     | 2     | Add "so what"   |
| ... | ...          | ...      | ...   | ... |

Weekly Average: __ / 5
Biggest Gap: ________________
Focus for Next Week: ________________
```

## Patterns to Watch For

### Pattern 1: Context-Heavy Opening
**Symptom:** Scores improve once you "get to the point"
**Diagnosis:** You're burying the lead
**Fix:** Answer first (see `01-Answer-First.md`)

---

### Pattern 2: Data Without Impact
**Symptom:** They ask "so what does this mean?"
**Diagnosis:** Missing the impact translation
**Fix:** Complete the DATA → MEANS → SHOULD chain (see `02-Impact-Translation.md`)

---

### Pattern 3: Audience Mismatch
**Symptom:** Good scores with peers, low scores with execs
**Diagnosis:** Not adapting to audience
**Fix:** Translate to their priorities ($, time, risk, etc.)

---

### Pattern 4: Written vs Verbal Gap
**Symptom:** Strong written communication, weak verbal (or vice versa)
**Diagnosis:** Different medium, different skills
**Fix:** Apply same principles to both; practice the weaker one more

---

## Building the Habit

### Week 1: Awareness
- Grade your 3 most important communications each day
- Just observe and note—don't try to change yet
- **Goal:** Build awareness of current patterns

### Week 2: Intervention
- Continue grading
- Before each communication, pause and apply one principle
- **Goal:** Start improving scores

### Week 3: Automation
- Grading becomes automatic
- You catch yourself before mistakes
- **Goal:** Scores consistently 4+

### Week 4+: Mastery
- Self-correction happens in real-time
- You rarely score below 4
- **Goal:** Maintain and refine

---

## Getting External Feedback

Self-grading is limited by self-awareness. Add external input:

### Method 1: Ask Directly
After a communication, ask:
- "Did that make sense? Was there anything I should have led with differently?"

### Method 2: Observe Carefully
Watch for:
- Did they take notes?
- Did they ask questions?
- Did they engage or disengage?
- Did they reference it later?

### Method 3: Request Specific Feedback
Ask your manager or a peer:
> "I'm working on being more concise and leading with the answer. Over the next week, can you let me know when I'm doing that well or poorly?"

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ **Grade immediately** - Don't wait; the moment after is most accurate
- ✅ **Be honest** - Low scores are learning opportunities
- ✅ **Track patterns** - Individual scores matter less than trends
- ✅ **Adjust continuously** - Every communication is practice
- ✅ **Get external input** - Self-assessment has blind spots

---

## The Meta-Skill

Self-grading isn't just about communication. It's about:

- **Continuous improvement** in everything
- **Self-awareness** as a professional skill
- **Pattern recognition** in your own behavior
- **Intentional practice** vs just "doing"

As Ian McAllister says:

> "If you build that muscle to try to do it better the next time and also just try to be a little self-aware about what could have gone better, then I think it's a really good muscle to build."
