## Answer First: BLUF Technique

**Before responding:**
1. What is the EXACT question?
2. What's my answer in one sentence?
3. Am I starting with answer or context?

**Structure:**
```
[Answer] → [Context] → [Details if needed]
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Yes, we should prioritize it. Here's why..."
- ✅ "12% lift in conversions. Here's the data..."
- ❌ "So, we've been tracking this and..."

---

## Impact Translation: The Formula

**Always use this pattern:**
```
[Data] → "This means..." → "So we should..."
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "DAU increased 10%. **This means** users are finding value. **So we should** double down on onboarding."
- ❌ "DAU increased 10%. We're seeing good signals."

---

## Self-Grading Rubric

**A:** Perfect landing. No follow-up questions. Decision made immediately.

**B:** Mostly landed. Minor clarification needed.

**C:** Partially landed. Multiple clarification questions.

**D:** Didn't land well. Significant confusion.

**F:** Complete failure. Misunderstanding.

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Status Update
**Question:** "How's the launch going?"

**Bad:**
> "Well, we've been monitoring the metrics, and there are some interesting things happening..."

**Good:**
> "It's going well—we're on track to hit our target. We've seen 12% adoption in the first week, which is above our 10% goal."

---

### Example 2: Data Question
**Question:** "What's the impact on trial conversions?"

**Bad:**
> "So we've been tracking this for a few weeks now, and the data shows some interesting patterns..."

**Good:**
> "12% lift in trial conversions, adding ~$15K MRR. This means our onboarding changes are working. So we should scale this to 100% of traffic next week."
