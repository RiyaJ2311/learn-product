## Thinking Patterns (Module 7)

### Q23: What would have to be true for this to work?
**Theme:** First Principles Thinking
**Framework:** Assumption Audit
**When to use:** Before any major decision or strategy

**What it means:** Identify the assumptions underlying your decision. If those assumptions are wrong, the decision is wrong.

**How to apply:**
1. List your key assumptions
2. Rate confidence in each
3. Identify which, if wrong, would change the decision
4. Test the riskiest assumption first

---

### Q24: How could this fail spectacularly?
**Theme:** Inversion / Pre-Mortem
**Framework:** Inversion Thinking
**When to use:** Before launches, major decisions, new initiatives

**What it means:** Imagine failure, then work backwards to prevent it. This surfaces risks optimism hides.

**How to apply:**
1. Imagine it's 3 months later and this failed badly
2. Write down all the reasons it failed
3. Prioritize the most likely/impactful
4. Create mitigation for top 3

---

### Q25: And then what happens?
**Theme:** Second-Order Thinking
**Framework:** Consequence Chains
**When to use:** Before any decision with ripple effects

**What it means:** Consider the consequences of consequences. Most decisions have second and third-order effects that aren't immediately obvious.

**How to apply:**
1. State the first-order effect
2. Ask "And then what?" for each effect
3. Repeat 3-4 times
4. Check for unintended consequences

---

### Q26: What am I not seeing?
**Theme:** Cognitive Bias Awareness
**Framework:** Bias Check
**When to use:** When you feel certain about something

**What it means:** The moment you're most confident is often when you're most at risk of bias. This question creates space for doubt.

**How to apply:**
1. Ask what evidence would change your mind
2. Consider who might disagree and why
3. Check for confirmation bias
4. Seek disconfirming evidence

---

### Q27: What's the bottleneck in this system?
**Theme:** Systems Thinking
**Framework:** Constraint Analysis
**When to use:** When analyzing funnels, processes, or growth

**What it means:** Every system has a constraint that limits overall performance. Find it, and you find the highest-leverage intervention point.

**How to apply:**
1. Map the system (elements, connections)
2. Find where flow is restricted
3. Focus improvement on the constraint
4. After fixing, find the new constraint

---

### Q28: Is this reversible?
**Theme:** Decision Quality
**Framework:** Reversibility Test
**When to use:** When deciding how much rigor to apply

**What it means:** Reversible decisions deserve less deliberation than irreversible ones. Match your effort to the stakes.

**How to apply:**
1. Rate reversibility: Easy / Hard / Impossible
2. Easy → Decide fast, learn from results
3. Hard → Careful analysis, get input
4. Impossible → Maximum rigor, sleep on it

---

### Q29: Would I still do this if I hadn't already started?
**Theme:** Sunk Cost Awareness
**Framework:** Fresh Eyes Test
**When to use:** When continuing a struggling project or feature

**What it means:** Past investment is irrelevant to future decisions. Only future value matters.

**How to apply:**
1. Imagine you're starting fresh today
2. With current knowledge, would you start this?
3. If no, consider stopping regardless of past investment
4. If yes, continue with confidence
