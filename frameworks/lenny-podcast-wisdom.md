## Ian McAllister (ex-Amazon, Uber, Airbnb)

**Episode Focus:** Top 1% PM Skills

### Framework 1: The Five Skills of Top PMs

1. **COMMUNICATE** - Answer first, then explain
2. **PRIORITIZE** - Ruthless focus on impact
3. **EXECUTE** - Ship with quality and speed
4. **THINK BIG** - Expand before contracting
5. **EARN TRUST** - Build relationships that carry strategy

---

### Framework 2: Answer First, Then Explain

> "Don't bury the lead. Start with the answer, then provide context if needed. Most people do it backwards."

**Framework:** Answer the exact question in the first sentence, then provide context.

**Application:** Before any communication, identify the ONE thing they need to know and put it first.

---

### Framework 3: Self-Grading Communication

> "Grade yourself after every communication. Did it land? What would you do differently? This continuous improvement mindset applies to everything."

**Framework:** After every important message or meeting, score yourself 1-5 and note one adjustment.

**Application:** After every important message or meeting, score yourself 1-5 and note one adjustment.

---

### Framework 4: Earn Trust

> "Trust is the currency of a product leader. If you don't build the support and relationships, the right strategy may not get executed."

**Framework:** Build trust by delivering consistently, communicating clearly, and making impact visible.

**Application:** Before pushing for a decision, ask: Have I invested in the relationship with the people who need to execute?

---

### Framework 5: Working Backwards (Amazon)

> "If you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem. Working backwards means starting with the customer problem, not the solution you want to build."

**Framework:** Amazon's PR/FAQ method. Write the press release first, then work backwards.

**Application:** Every PRD should have a clear problem paragraph. If you can't write it, you're not ready to write the doc.

---

### Framework 6: Think Like an Owner

> "Think beyond just your one little bubble. Think about the broader business outside of the one little product you might be working on."

**Framework:** Think beyond your immediate scope to the broader business impact.

**Application:** For every decision, ask: What would I do if I were CEO of this metric?

---

## Shaun Clowes (CPO, Confluent; ex-Atlassian)

**Episode Focus:** Data-Informed Product Management

### Framework 1: Data as Compass, Not GPS

> "If you look at data as a way of giving you the answer, you're always wrong or you're slow. Data is more about disproving whatever you think."

**Framework:** Don't make decisions from single data points. Check upstream, downstream, and one level up.

**Application:** Use data to validate or invalidate hypotheses, not to tell you what to do.

---

### Framework 2: Click Left, Right, and Up

> "Go a click to the left (what happened before), a click to the right (what happened after), and a click up (the metric above). If you still see your story, then you've got something compelling."

**Framework:** Check upstream (left), downstream (right), and one level up before presenting data.

**Application:** Before presenting any data point, answer these three questions.

---

### Framework 3: The 80% Rule

> "Spend 80% of your time thinking about things going on outside the building—customer, market, competitor. If you let your calendar rule you, nothing good will happen."

**Framework:** 80% of time outside (users, competitors, market), 20% inside (meetings, docs, building).

**Application:** Block time weekly for customer research, competitor analysis, and market trends.

---

### Framework 4: Don't Bring a Knife to a Gunfight

> "If you present data with authority and it's full of holes, you don't just not get benefit—you lose brownie points. It would be better not to show up with an analysis than to show up with one that's dumb."

**Framework:** Presenting weak data analysis damages trust more than not presenting at all.

**Application:** Before presenting data, stress-test it. Would it survive skeptical questioning?

---

### Framework 5: Incentives Drive Behavior

> "People only do what their incentives tell them to do. You get what you measure."

**Framework:** Behavior follows incentives. If something isn't happening, check the incentives.

**Application:** If a behavior isn't happening, check the incentives. Is anyone measured on this outcome?

---

### Framework 6: The Bingo Card Career

> "My career has been like a bingo card—always looking to fill in boxes I didn't have. Each role taught me something new that became a superpower later."

**Framework:** Seek diverse experiences that stretch you into unfamiliar territory.

**Application:** Seek experiences that stretch you into unfamiliar territory.

---

### Baseline First
> "No docs without baselines."

**Framework:** Never analyze without a baseline. Always establish historical, target, or benchmark baselines.

**Application:** Before sharing any metric, establish the baseline. Show current vs baseline. Explain what it means.

---

## Jackie Bavaro (Author, ex-Asana/Google)

**Episode Focus:** PM Strategy and Coaching

### Framework 1: Don't Be Defensive

> "Don't say no to everything defensively. Consider others' ideas as problem statements—they're identifying something that matters to them."

**Framework:** When someone proposes something, treat it as a problem statement, not a solution to reject.

**Application:** When someone proposes something you disagree with, ask: What problem are they trying to solve?

---

### Framework 2: Strategy as Reliable, Differentiated Value

> "Good strategy is finding reliable, differentiated value. It's not about being different—it's about being different in a way that matters."

**Framework:** Strategy should create predictable, repeatable value for users and the business.

**Application:** Your strategy should answer: Why will this work? Why us? Why now?

---

### Framework 3: Solutions as Problem Statements

> "When someone gives you a solution, interpret it as a problem statement. They've identified something important—your job is to find the best solution."

**Framework:** Solutions solve problems but create new ones. Understand the trade-offs.

**Application:** Translate "we should build X" into "the problem is Y"—then solve for Y.

- Verify your work is live

### Strategy
- Start with customer experience
- Spend 80% time outside the building
- Write PRDs that solve problems

### Leadership

## Key Questions from Frameworks

### Communication
- Did I answer the EXACT question first?
- Did I say "This means..." and "So we should..."?
- Did the message land? (Self-grade)

### Data
- What happened upstream/downstream of this data?
- What's the metric one level up?
- Do I have baseline metrics?

### Ownership
- Am I waiting for permission unnecessarily?
- Can I post this publicly without asking?
- What would I do as CEO of this metric?

### Strategy
- What does the customer actually experience?
- What are competitors doing?
- Have I verified this problem exists in the wild?

### PRD Quality
- Does this have a clear PROBLEM paragraph?
- Controllable vs track-only metrics?
- What are the guardrails?

### Leadership
- Did I sell impact in stakeholder language?
- Have I repeated this win enough to stick?
