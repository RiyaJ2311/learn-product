# Why This Exists

This is my personal system for becoming the PM I want to be.

---

## The Problem I'm Solving

I've received feedback. Good feedback. The kind that stings because it's true. Patterns emerged:

- **I bury the answer.** I give context when people want conclusions.
- **I present data without meaning.** Numbers without the "so what?"
- **I wait for permission.** When I should just act.
- **I think inside-out.** Starting from what we're building, not what customers need.

These aren't character flaws. They're habits. And habits can be rewired.

## What I'm Building Here

This isn't a course to complete. It's a system to practice.

**The goal:** Make excellent PM thinking automatic. Not something I have to remember, but something I just *do*.

I've taken frameworks from PMs I admire—people at Amazon, Atlassian, Uber, Airbnb—and turned them into questions I ask myself daily. Questions like:

- Did I answer the actual question first?
- What does this data *mean* for what we should do?
- Am I waiting for permission I don't actually need?
- Have I talked to a real customer about this problem?

When I ask these questions enough, they become instinct.

## The Core Shifts I'm Working On

### 1. Communication: Answer First, Context Second
Stop making people dig for the point. Lead with the conclusion. "We should do X because Y" not "Let me walk you through the data..."

### 2. Data: From Numbers to Decisions
Data isn't impressive by itself. The question is always: "So what? What should we do differently?"

### 3. Ownership: Act Like the CEO of My Metrics
Don't ask "Can I do this?" Ask "Why haven't I done this already?" Take ownership of outcomes, not just tasks.

### 4. Strategy: Start with the Customer, Not the Solution
Spend more time understanding the problem than building the solution. Talk to users. Look at competitors. Think outside-in.

### 5. Trust: Earn It Through Consistency
Trust isn't given, it's built. Through follow-through, through impact, through being the person who makes things happen.

## How I'll Use This

**Before meetings:** Glance at the relevant questions. Prime my brain.

**After communication:** Grade myself. Did the message land? What would I do differently?

**Weekly:** Reflect on what worked, what didn't. Adjust.

**When I get feedback:** Map it back to these frameworks. Find the pattern. Practice the fix.

---

## The Bet I'm Making

If I practice these patterns consistently for months, they'll become automatic. I won't have to *think* about answering first—I'll just do it. I won't have to *remind* myself to ask "so what?"—it'll be my default.

That's the bet. Deliberate practice → unconscious competence.

---

## Reminder to Myself

This isn't about being perfect. It's about being better than yesterday.

The feedback I've received is a gift. It shows me exactly where to focus. Most people never get this clarity.

Now I just have to do the work.
