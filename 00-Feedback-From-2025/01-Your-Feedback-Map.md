# My 2025 Feedback Map

Real feedback from Akash and Puru, mapped to what I'm doing about it.

## The Raw Feedback

These are actual quotes from my 2025 reviews and 1:1s.

### On Communication
> "Answer the exact question being asked, not adjacent ones"

> "When sharing data, translate it into impact/meaning ('so what?'), not just raw numbers"

> "Reduce English and fluff; increase clarity and precision"

### On Data
> "Data is currently too weak and unstructured to support strong product decisions"

> "There is no baseline metric"

> "You open the dashboard and leave it open... you have to cut down the paths"

### On Ownership
> "You should always decide it on your own... permissionless for user flow"

> "Waits for validation before acting; hesitates to post publicly"

> "Not seen as an 'owner' until you track the metric week over week"

### On PRDs
> "Story is good, but the spine is weak"

> Missing: Activation definition, Controllable vs uncontrollable metrics, Trusted data queries, Clear v1 scope, Guardrails

### On Impact
> "You move on from wins without making sure they stick in leadership's mind"

> "Poor impact communication - work like top nav helped, but it didn't get repeated upward"

## Theme 1: Communication Clarity

**The pattern:** I provide context before the answer. People have to dig for the point.

**The fix:**
- Answer the exact question in the first sentence
- Then provide context
- End with "So we should..."

**Questions I ask myself:**
- Did I answer the EXACT question first?
- Did I say "This means..." and "So we should..."?
- Would someone skim this and get the point?

**Module:** [01-Communication-Clarity/](../01-Communication-Clarity/)

---

## Theme 2: Data Storytelling

**The pattern:** I show data without narrative. No baselines. No "so what?"

**The fix:**
- Always establish baseline before presenting change
- Triangulate: What happened before? After? One level up?
- End every data point with what it means for decisions

**Questions I ask myself:**
- What's the baseline?
- What happened upstream and downstream?
- What should we do differently because of this?

**Module:** [02-Data-Storytelling/](../02-Data-Storytelling/)

---

## Theme 3: Permissionless Execution

**The pattern:** I wait for approval on things I could decide myself.

**The fix:**
- If it's within my scope, just do it
- Post publicly without asking
- Act like the CEO of my metric

**Questions I ask myself:**
- Am I waiting for permission I don't need?
- Can I just do this and share the result?
- What would I do if this was my company?

**Module:** [03-Ownership-Execution/](../03-Ownership-Execution/)

---

## Theme 4: Metric Ownership

**The pattern:** I check metrics when asked, not proactively.

**The fix:**
- Weekly dashboard review, same day every week
- Know the variance vs last week without being asked
- Surface insights before being asked

**Questions I ask myself:**
- Can I explain this week's numbers vs last week?
- Am I tracking this proactively or reactively?
- What would an owner do that I'm not doing?

**Module:** [03-Ownership-Execution/](../03-Ownership-Execution/)

---

## Theme 5: PRD Quality

**The pattern:** Good narrative, weak structure. Missing rigor.

**The fix:**
- Problem paragraph before anything else
- Separate controllable metrics from track-only
- Define guardrails upfront
- Crisp v1 scope

**Questions I ask myself:**
- Is the problem crystal clear?
- Can I actually move the metrics I'm tracking?
- What could go wrong and how will I know?

**Module:** [04-Product-Strategy/](../04-Product-Strategy/)

---

## Theme 6: Outside-In Thinking

**The pattern:** I start from our solution, not the customer's problem.

**The fix:**
- Spend time understanding what customers actually experience
- Look at competitors
- Verify problems exist in the wild, not just in data

**Questions I ask myself:**
- What does the customer see today?
- What are competitors doing?
- Have I validated this problem outside our walls?

**Module:** [04-Product-Strategy/](../04-Product-Strategy/)

---

## Theme 7: Impact Selling

**The pattern:** I complete work and move on. Wins don't stick.

**The fix:**
- Translate impact to stakeholder language
- Repeat wins until they're remembered
- Make sure leadership knows what I delivered

**Questions I ask myself:**
- Did I communicate this in terms stakeholders care about?
- Have I repeated this enough for it to stick?
- Would leadership remember this in my next review?

**Module:** [05-Leadership-Trust/](../05-Leadership-Trust/)

## Tracking Progress

### January 2025 Focus
- [ ] Answer first in every message for 2 weeks straight
- [ ] Add baselines to every data point I share
- [ ] Post one metric update publicly without asking

### How I Know It's Working
- Feedback themes start changing (I stop hearing the same things)
- Akash/Puru notice improvement
- I catch myself doing it right without thinking
