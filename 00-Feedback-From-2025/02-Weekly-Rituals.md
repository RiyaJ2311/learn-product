# Weekly Rituals & Daily Practices

## 2-Minute Overview

Knowing frameworks isn't enough. This document outlines specific rituals to build PM excellence into your daily habits. The goal: **make great PM behaviors automatic.**

---

## Daily Practices (5-10 minutes)

### Morning: Set Your Lens (2 mins)

Before starting work, pick ONE question for the day:

| Day | Lens Question |
|-----|---------------|
| Monday | "Will I answer the exact question first today?" |
| Tuesday | "Will I say 'This means...' after every data point?" |
| Wednesday | "Am I waiting for permission on anything I could decide?" |
| Thursday | "What's one level up from the metrics I'm looking at?" |
| Friday | "Did I sell my impact in stakeholder language this week?" |

**Write it on a sticky note. Check it before every meeting.**

---

### Before Every Meeting (1 min)

Ask yourself:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PRE-MEETING CHECKLIST                              │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ □ What is the ONE thing they need to know?         │
│ □ What question am I being asked to answer?        │
│ □ What data/evidence supports my point?            │
│ □ What's the "so what" → "so we should"?           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### After Every Meeting (2 mins)

Self-grade your communication:

| Question | Score (1-5) |
|----------|-------------|
| Did I answer the question first? | ___ |
| Did I connect data to impact? | ___ |
| Did I make a clear recommendation? | ___ |
| Did the message land? | ___ |

**If average < 3:** Review what went wrong. Apply tomorrow.

---

### Before Sending Any Written Communication (30 secs)

**The "Move the Last Sentence" test:**

1. Write your message
2. Read the last sentence
3. If it's the main point, **move it to the top**
4. Delete any fluff that came before it

### Monday Planning (10 mins)

Start each week with:

**1. Review last Friday's reflection**
- What was my #1 improvement area?
- What question am I using as my lens?

**2. Scan the week ahead**
- Which meetings need Answer-First prep?
- Any PRDs/docs due? (Do baseline check now)
- Any data reviews? (Prep triangulation)

**3. Set one measurable goal**
- "I will answer-first in 5/5 meetings this week"
- "I will post one update publicly without asking"
- "I will say 'This means...' in every data share"

---

## Monthly Rituals

### First Monday: Deep Review (30 mins)

**1. Review all weekly reflections from past month**
- What patterns emerge?
- Which grades are improving?
- Which are stuck?

**2. Compare to feedback themes**
- Open `01-Your-Feedback-Map.md`
- Are the priority themes improving?
- Any new themes emerging?

**3. Adjust learning priorities**
- If a theme is mastered, move to next
- If stuck, re-read the module content
- Consider asking for specific feedback

---

## Quarterly: Feedback Sync (1 hour)

**1. Request explicit feedback**
- Ask your manager: "On [specific theme], how am I doing compared to 3 months ago?"

**2. Update your feedback map**
- Add new feedback to `feedback-vault/`
- Update priority scores
- Identify new themes

**3. Celebrate progress**
- Note specific improvements

| After any meeting | 2-min self-grade |
| Before lunch | Quick metric check on your dashboard |
| End of day | Did I post anything publicly today? |
| Friday EOD | 15-min weekly reflection |

## Thinking Patterns Practice

### Weekly Thinking Audit

Add this to your Friday reflection:

| Question | This Week |
|----------|-----------|

## Tracking Progress Over Time

### Weekly Score Tracking

```
Week | Comm | Data | Own | PRD | Impact | Think | Focus
-----|------|------|-----|-----|--------|-------|------
W1   | __/5 | __/5 | __/5| __/5| __/5   | __/5  | [theme]
W2   | __/5 | __/5 | __/5| __/5| __/5   | __/5  | [theme]
W3   | __/5 | __/5 | __/5| __/5| __/5   | __/5  | [theme]
W4   | __/5 | __/5 | __/5| __/5| __/5   | __/5  | [theme]
```

### Monthly Trend

If scores aren't improving after 4 weeks:
1. Re-read the module content
2. Ask for specific feedback on that theme
3. Find a peer to practice with
4. Consider a different approach

---

## Emergency Checklists

### "I'm about to ramble" - Stop and:
1. What's the ONE thing they need to know?
2. Say that first
3. Ask: "Do you want more detail?"

### "I don't know the answer" - Say:
1. "I don't have that number right now"
2. "My best estimate is X"
3. "I'll confirm by [time]"

### "I'm about to ask for permission" - Check:
1. Can I post this publicly?
2. Is this reversible?
3. Is this within my scope?
4. If all yes → Just do it

### "I'm presenting data" - Include:
1. The number (answer first)
2. The baseline (vs what?)
3. The meaning (this means...)
4. The action (so we should...)

### "I feel certain about this decision" - Pause and:
1. Ask "What would prove me wrong?"
2. Check for confirmation bias
3. Consider what you might not be seeing
4. Get a second opinion

### "I'm about to launch something" - Run:
1. Quick pre-mortem: "How could this fail?"
2. List top 3 failure modes
3. Create mitigation for each
4. Then proceed with confidence

### "I'm stuck on a problem" - Try:
1. First principles: What do we know for certain?
2. Inversion: What would guarantee failure?
3. Systems: What's the real bottleneck?
4. Fresh eyes: How would a newcomer see this?

**Remember:** Excellence is not an act, it's a habit. These rituals build the habits.
