# Start Here

This is my PM growth system built from real feedback I received in 2025.

## The Feedback That Started This

In early 2025, patterns emerged from my reviews with Akash and Puru. The same themes kept appearing:

| What I Heard | What It Really Means |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "Answer the exact question being asked" | I bury the point in context |
| "Data is too weak and unstructured" | I show numbers without meaning |
| "You should decide it on your own" | I wait for permission too often |
| "Story is good but spine is weak" | My PRDs lack rigor |
| "Not seen as owner until you track weekly" | I'm reactive, not proactive |

These aren't criticisms. They're a roadmap.

## My 2025 Priority Stack

Based on frequency and impact from feedback:

### Tier 1: Fix Now
1. **Communication Clarity** — Stop making people dig for answers
2. **Data Storytelling** — Make data mean something

### Tier 2: Build Next
3. **Permissionless Execution** — Act without asking
4. **Metric Ownership** — Own numbers week over week
5. **PRD Quality** — Strong spine, not just good story

### Tier 3: Level Up
6. **Outside-In Thinking** — Start with customers, not solutions
7. **Trust & Impact Selling** — Make wins stick

## The Modules

Each module tackles one feedback theme with frameworks from PMs who've figured this out.

### Module 1: Communication Clarity
**My gap:** "Answer the exact question, not adjacent ones"
**The fix:** Lead with the answer. Context comes second.
**Go to:** [01-Communication-Clarity/](../01-Communication-Clarity/)

### Module 2: Data Storytelling
**My gap:** "No baseline metric after 6 months"
**The fix:** Every number needs context, comparison, and "so what?"
**Go to:** [02-Data-Storytelling/](../02-Data-Storytelling/)

### Module 3: Ownership & Execution
**My gap:** "Waits for validation before acting"
**The fix:** Default to action. Ask forgiveness, not permission.
**Go to:** [03-Ownership-Execution/](../03-Ownership-Execution/)

### Module 4: Product Strategy
**My gap:** "Story is good but spine is weak"
**The fix:** Problem first. Metrics defined. Scope crisp.
**Go to:** [04-Product-Strategy/](../04-Product-Strategy/)

### Module 5: Leadership & Trust
**My gap:** "Move on from wins without making them stick"
**The fix:** Sell impact. Repeat it. Make it memorable.
**Go to:** [05-Leadership-Trust/](../05-Leadership-Trust/)

### Module 6: Product-Led Growth
**My context:** PLG at PushOwl — pricing, activation, retention
**The fix:** Build systematic growth, not one-off experiments
**Go to:** [06-Product-Led-Growth/](../06-Product-Led-Growth/)

## How I'm Using This

**Daily:** Before meetings, review one relevant question. Apply it. Note what happened.

**Weekly:** Friday reflection — what worked, what didn't, what to focus on next week.

**Monthly:** Review progress against feedback themes. Am I hearing the same things less?

## Where to Start

1. **First:** Read [01-Your-Feedback-Map.md](01-Your-Feedback-Map.md) — my specific gaps mapped to fixes
2. **Then:** Pick the highest-priority module and start with its 00-Index.md
3. **Practice:** Use the questions before every meeting
4. **Reflect:** Complete the weekly reflection in [tests/](../tests/)

## The Goal

**From:** "Story is good, but spine is weak"
**To:** "This is exactly what I needed"

That's it. Everything in this system exists to close that gap.
