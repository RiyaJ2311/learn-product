# Learn Code

Practical software engineering concepts and hands-on coding projects.

## What's Here

This section contains:
1. **Foundational concepts** - Software engineering principles that apply broadly
2. **Code projects** - Hands-on implementations and experiments
3. **Cross-domain guides** - Topics that apply beyond any single domain

---

## Contents

### Foundational Concepts

**[Observability](observability/)** - Understand systems by examining their outputs
- Applies to: Web apps, microservices, mobile backends, AI agents, distributed systems
- Core concepts: Logs, metrics, traces
- Tools: Honeycomb, Datadog, Grafana, and more

**[API Design](api-design/)** - Design APIs that developers love
- REST principles, naming, versioning
- Error handling and authentication
- Documentation best practices
- Applies to REST APIs, GraphQL, and AI tool interfaces

**[System Architecture](system-architecture/)** - Design systems that scale and evolve
- Coupling, cohesion, boundaries
- Patterns: monolith, microservices, event-driven
- Trade-offs and decision making
- Evolution strategies

### Code Projects

**[Chrome Extension](chrome-extension/)** - Browser extension development
- Practical example of building browser extensions
- Manifest V3, content scripts, background workers

## Philosophy

Software engineering concepts transcend specific domains. Observability principles apply whether you're building traditional APIs or AI agents. API design patterns work for REST endpoints and LLM tool calling. System architecture thinking helps with microservices and agent systems.

This section captures those cross-cutting concepts and provides hands-on implementations.

## Cross-References

Many concepts here connect to domain-specific guides:

| **API Design** | [api-design/](api-design/) | [AI Tool Calling](../08-AI-Skills/03-AI-Agents/03-Tool-Calling.md) |
| **System Architecture** | [system-architecture/](system-architecture/) | [Agent Patterns](../08-AI-Skills/03-AI-Agents/02-Agent-Patterns.md) |
