# Outside-In Thinking

**Framework:** Shaun Clowes (80% rule)

**Core Principle:** Spend 80% of your time outside the building.

---

## The Problem

PMs often spend too much time inside the building (meetings, docs, planning) and not enough time outside (users, competitors, market). This leads to:
- Building features users don't want
- Missing competitive threats
- Not understanding the market

**Bad Pattern:**
> "We should build X. Let me write a PRD."

**Good Pattern:**
> "Users are struggling with Y. Competitors are doing Z. The market is moving toward W. So we should build X."

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Spend Time Outside
80% of your time should be:
- **Users:** Talking to users, understanding their problems
- **Competitors:** Researching competitors, understanding their approach
- **Market:** Understanding market trends, industry shifts
- **Data:** Analyzing user behavior, market data

20% of your time should be:
- **Inside:** Meetings, docs, planning, building

### Step 2: Synthesize Insights
From outside time, synthesize:
- What problems do users have?
- What are competitors doing?
- What's happening in the market?
- What patterns do you see?

### Step 3: Make Decisions
Based on outside insights:
- What should we build?
- What should we prioritize?
- What should we avoid?

### Step 4: Verify Before Building
Before building, verify:
- Does this problem exist in the wild?
- Are users actually asking for this?
- Are competitors solving this?
- Is the market ready for this?

## The 80% Rule

**80% Outside:**
- User research (interviews, surveys, support tickets)
- Competitive analysis (products, pricing, positioning)
- Market research (trends, industry reports, analyst insights)
- Data analysis (user behavior, metrics, patterns)

**20% Inside:**
- Meetings (standups, planning, reviews)
- Documentation (PRDs, specs, updates)
- Planning (roadmaps, prioritization)
- Building (working with engineering)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Decision

**Bad (Inside-Out):**
> "We should build a new dashboard. Let me write a PRD."

**Good (Outside-In):**
> "I talked to 10 users. 8 said they can't find the metrics they need. Competitors all have customizable dashboards. Market research shows dashboard customization is table stakes. So we should build a customizable dashboard."

---

### Example 2: Prioritization

**Bad (Inside-Out):**
> "Let's prioritize feature X because it's on the roadmap."

**Good (Outside-In):**
> "Users are asking for feature Y (50 support tickets). Competitors launched feature Y last quarter. Market research shows feature Y is becoming standard. So we should prioritize feature Y over feature X."

---

### Example 3: Problem Validation

**Bad (Inside-Out):**
> "Users probably want feature X. Let's build it."

**Good (Outside-In):**
> "I talked to 20 users. 15 said they want feature X. I verified this problem exists in the wild. Competitors don't solve this well. So let's build feature X."

---

## Practice Questions

Before building anything, ask:
- [ ] Have I talked to users about this?
- [ ] What are competitors doing?
- [ ] What's happening in the market?
- [ ] Have I verified this problem exists in the wild?

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Much Time Inside
**Problem:** Spending 80% of time in meetings and docs.
**Fix:** Force yourself to spend 80% outside. Schedule user interviews, competitive research, market analysis.

### Mistake 2: Not Verifying Problems
**Problem:** Assuming problems exist without verifying.
**Fix:** Talk to users. Verify problems exist in the wild.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Competitors
**Problem:** Not researching what competitors are doing.
**Fix:** Regularly research competitors. Understand their approach.

### Mistake 4: Not Understanding Market
**Problem:** Not understanding market trends and shifts.
**Fix:** Read industry reports, analyst insights, market research.

## Your Real Examples

> Based on actual feedback: "Business context was not even clear, didn't know what even was TikTok slideshow"

### Example: The TikTok Slideshow Gap

**The Situation:**
Presenting a feature proposal for TikTok slideshow support in a strategy meeting

**What Happened (Before):**
> Presented technical solution and implementation plan
> Assumed everyone understood the TikTok slideshow format
> Jumped straight to "here's what we should build"

**The Feedback:**
> "Business context was not even clear, didn't know what even was TikTok slideshow"

**What to Do Instead (After):**

**Start with the Outside-In context:**
> **What is a TikTok slideshow?**
> "A slideshow on TikTok is a multi-image carousel format (3-10 images) with music overlay. It's TikTok's answer to Instagram carousels but with higher engagement—40% more watch time than single-image posts."
>
> **Why does this matter for our merchants?**
> "Our top merchants are asking for this because their TikTok content gets 3x engagement vs Instagram, but they can't use our tool to create TikTok-native formats."
>
> **What are competitors doing?**
> "Competitor A launched TikTok slideshow support in Q3. Competitor B is in beta. We're behind."
>
> **Market context:**
> "TikTok is now the #1 discovery platform for e-commerce in Gen Z. 45% of users have purchased after seeing a product on TikTok."
>
> **Then** → "Here's what we should build..."

---

### Example: Customer Experience First

**The Situation:**
Proposing an activation improvement feature

**What Happened (Before):**
> "Here's my proposal for improving the onboarding flow. We'll add tooltips and guided steps."

**What to Do Instead (After):**
> **What does the customer actually experience today?**
> "Let me show you what a new merchant sees: [screen recording]
> - They sign up (30 seconds)
> - They hit this wall: 'Create a campaign' with no guidance
> - 40% abandon here because they don't know what a campaign is
> - The ones who continue take 3 days to send their first push"
>
> **What are competitors doing?**
> "Competitor A has a 5-minute guided setup. Competitor B uses a template library."
>
> **Then** → "Here's how we should fix it..."

**Key Takeaway:** Before proposing a solution, demonstrate that you deeply understand the customer experience and market context.

### The "Business Context" Checklist

Before presenting ANY feature or strategy:

**Customer Context:**
- [ ] Can I show what the customer experiences today? (screen recording, user quote, support ticket)
- [ ] Do I have specific user feedback about this problem? (quotes, ticket counts, interview notes)

**Competitive Context:**
- [ ] What are the top 3 competitors doing? (screenshots, pricing, features)
- [ ] Are we ahead, behind, or on par?

**Market Context:**
- [ ] What's the market trend? (data point or industry report)
- [ ] Why does this matter NOW? (timing rationale)

**If you can't answer these, you need more outside time before the presentation.**

---

### Quick Fix: The 2-Minute Context Opener

When presenting anything, spend the first 2 minutes on outside-in context:

```
"Before I share my proposal, let me ground us in the context:

1. CUSTOMER: Here's what users experience today... [30 sec]
2. COMPETITOR: Here's what competitors are doing... [30 sec]
3. MARKET: Here's why this matters now... [30 sec]
4. PROBLEM: So the problem we're solving is... [30 sec]

Now, here's my proposal..."
```

**Remember:** 80% outside, 20% inside. Verify problems exist in the wild.
