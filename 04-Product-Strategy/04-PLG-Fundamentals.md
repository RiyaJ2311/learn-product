# PLG Fundamentals

**Core Principle:** Product-led growth means the product is the primary driver of acquisition, conversion, and expansion.

**Framework:** Data-backed funnel thinking applied to product experience.

---

## 2-Minute Summary

**What is PLG?** Product-Led Growth means your product is the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion - not sales or marketing.

**Why it matters:** PLG creates defensible businesses with lower CAC, higher retention, and compounding growth effects.

**The key insight:** PLG isn't anti-sales - it's about making your product so good that users become buyers, and buyers become advocates.

**Quick test:** Could a user sign up, experience value, and pay - without ever talking to a human?

## The Origin Story

From Shaun Clowes on building PLG at Atlassian (2012):

> "At that time, growth hacking was a thing in B2C. People could see Facebook doing their '10 friends in 7 days' and they're like, 'That's amazing.' At Atlassian we set out to go, 'Okay, do those techniques work in B2B?' And now I would say it's pretty clear that the juice is worth the squeeze."

---

## What Atlassian Proved

- No sales team - software sold itself or didn't sell at all
- 300,000+ customers - at scale, through product alone
- Industry standard - proved B2B PLG was possible

## PLG vs Traditional Go-to-Market

```
SALES-LED (Traditional)

Marketing -> MQL -> SDR -> AE -> Close -> CS -> Expansion

Characteristics:
- Buyer != User (procurement decides)
- High CAC (sales team cost)
- Features driven by buyer requests
- Distribution covers product faults
- Winner: Best sales team
```

```
PRODUCT-LED (PLG)

Traffic -> Signup -> Activate -> Convert -> Expand -> Refer

Characteristics:
- Buyer = User (user decides)
- Low CAC (product does selling)
- Features driven by actual usage
- Product must earn every user
- Winner: Best product experience
```

## The PLG Advantage: Compounding Effects

### Why PLG Creates Moats

From Shaun Clowes:

> "You can't be that successful as a company if you have a lot of revenue but a small number of customers - you're captive. You can't be that successful if you have a lot of customers but not enough revenue. The magic is in having both: a very large number of customers AND a very large amount of revenue. It's very hard to knock over a company like that."

### The Math

**Sales-Led:**
- 100 enterprise customers x $100K = $10M ARR
- Lose 10 customers = 10% revenue loss
- High concentration risk

**PLG:**
- 10,000 customers x $1K = $10M ARR
- Lose 100 customers = 1% revenue loss
- Low concentration, high defensibility

## When PLG Works (and Doesn't)

### PLG Works When:

**End user can evaluate the product**
- They can sign up and try without IT approval
- Value is demonstrable without customization
- Low barrier to initial usage

**Time to value is short**
- User experiences benefit quickly
- "Aha moment" happens in first session
- Value compounds with usage

**Virality is possible**
- Product benefits from multiple users
- Users want to invite others
- Collaboration is core to value

**Price point allows self-serve**
- Low enough for credit card purchase
- Or freemium model viable
- ROI is obvious to individual user

### PLG Struggles When:

**Complex enterprise sales**
- Requires security review, procurement
- Implementation needs services
- Value requires organizational change

**High-touch required**
- Product needs training to use
- Value requires customization
- Support is part of the product

**Buyer != User is unavoidable**
- Procurement makes decisions
- User has no budget authority
- Value is organizational, not individual

## The PLG Mindset Shift

### From Features to Funnels

**Traditional PM thinking:**
- "What features should we build?"
- "What does the buyer want?"
- "How do we win the RFP?"

**PLG PM thinking:**
- "Where do users drop off?"
- "How fast do they reach value?"
- "What makes them come back?"

### The Questions to Ask

| Traditional | PLG |
| --- | --- |
| What features does the buyer want? | Where do users drop off in the funnel? |
| How do we win against competitors? | How do we reduce time to value? |
| What does the sales team need? | What makes users come back tomorrow? |
| How do we hit quota? | How do we increase activation rate? |

## Your PLG Assessment

Answer these questions:

1. **Can users self-serve?**
   - Yes, fully self-serve signup to payment
   - Partially, need some human touch
   - No, requires sales conversation

2. **What's your time to value?**
   - Minutes (immediate value)
   - Hours (same session)
   - Days (requires setup)
   - Weeks (requires integration)

3. **Is there viral potential?**
   - Yes, product is better with more users
   - Somewhat, users can invite others
   - No, single-player product

4. **What's your price point?**
   - <$50/mo (credit card friendly)
   - $50-500/mo (small business)
   - $500+/mo (requires approval)

**Scoring:**
- 4 "Yes/First option" = Strong PLG fit
- 2-3 = Hybrid model (PLG + Sales)
- 0-1 = Sales-led likely better

## The PLG Funnel

Every PLG company optimizes the same funnel:

```
ACQUISITION
- How do users find you?
- Metrics: Traffic, Signups, CAC

ACTIVATION
- Do users experience value?
- Metrics: Setup completion, First [action]

RETENTION
- Do users come back?
- Metrics: D1/D7/D30, DAU/MAU

REVENUE
- Do users pay?
- Metrics: Conversion rate, ARPU, LTV

REFERRAL
- Do users invite others?
- Metrics: NPS, Viral coefficient, Invites sent
```

## Common PLG Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating PLG as "No Sales"
**Reality:** The best PLG companies have sales - but sales closes deals the product sourced.

> "If you can get a PLG motion to feed your sales team, and a sales team motion to feed your PLG funnel when leads aren't ready yet, and you can get those motions playing with each other - you can make a lot of money." - Shaun Clowes

### Mistake 2: Random Experimentation
**Reality:** Growth needs to be systematic, not ad-hoc.

> "Many organizations fail because they don't really find the wins, or when they do find wins, it seems totally random. There's many different ways to fail from trying ideas to success to scaling to operationalizing."

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Quality
**Reality:** Conversion without retention is worthless.

From Shaun Clowes on holdout groups:

> "40% of the time, an experiment that shows positive long term turns out neutral. A temporary benefit that doesn't persist isn't necessarily a failure - but you need to know."

### Mistake 4: Sub-Optimizing
**Reality:** Optimizing signup doesn't matter if activation is broken.

> "Let's say I'm looking at onboarding success to second week retention. If you go upstream and find out that this intervention only applies to 2% of the inbound stream - it's meaningless."

## PLG at PushOwl: Your Context

Based on your work and feedback, your PLG funnel likely looks like:

Traffic -> Signup -> Install App -> Setup (Activation) -> First Campaign -> Trial -> Paid

### Key Questions for You

**What is "activated" for PushOwl?**
- First push sent?
- First automation live?
- First revenue attributed?

**Where's the biggest drop-off?**
- Install to setup?
- Setup to first campaign?
- Trial to paid?

**What's your time to value?**
- How fast can a store see results?
- What's blocking faster TTV?

## Key Takeaways

- PLG = product as primary growth driver - not anti-sales, but product-first
- End user focus - build for the user, not just the buyer
- Funnel thinking - every step matters, optimize systematically
- Quality over quantity - activation without retention is vanity
- Compound effects - many customers + revenue = defensibility
