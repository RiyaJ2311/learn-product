# PLG + Sales Hybrid

**Core Principle:** Pure PLG has limits. The best growth systems combine PLG scale with sales leverage.

**Framework:** PLG identifies -> Product qualifies -> Sales closes.

---

## 2-Minute Summary

**The problem:** Pure PLG has limits. At some point, you need sales to close bigger deals and accelerate growth.

**The solution:** Build a hybrid motion where PLG generates qualified leads and sales closes high-value opportunities.

**The framework:** PLG identifies -> Product qualifies -> Sales closes.

**Quick test:** Do you know which users should get a sales touch vs self-serve?

## Why Hybrid?

### The Limits of Pure PLG

From Shaun Clowes:

> "PLG is powerful, but it doesn't work for everyone. Enterprise deals, complex products, high-touch relationships - sometimes you need sales."

```
WHERE PLG STRUGGLES

1. Enterprise Deals
   - Multiple stakeholders
   - Security/compliance reviews
   - Custom requirements

2. Complex Products
   - Long time to value
   - Significant setup required
   - Training needed

3. High-Value Opportunities
   - Large potential deal size
   - Strategic accounts
   - Competitive displacement
```

---

## The Hybrid Advantage

**Pure PLG:**
- Wide top of funnel
- Low touch, scalable
- Self-serve conversion
- Limited by product's ability to sell itself

**Pure Sales:**
- Narrow top of funnel
- High touch, expensive
- Human-driven conversion
- Limited by sales capacity

**Hybrid:**
- Wide top of funnel (PLG)
- Low touch for majority (PLG)
- High touch for best opportunities (Sales)
- Best of both worlds

## The Hybrid Funnel

```
HYBRID PLG + SALES FUNNEL

ALL SIGNUPS (PLG)
  |
  |--> Self-Serve (80-90%) -> Freemium or Self-Serve Paid
  |
  |--> Product-Qualified Leads (10-20%)
          |
          |-> Sales Touch
              - SDR outreach
              - AE engagement
              - CS handoff
          |
          |-> High-Value Paid (Enterprise/Pro)
```

## Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs)

### What Is a PQL?
A user who has demonstrated through product usage that they're likely to become a valuable customer.

### PQL vs MQL

**MQL (Marketing-Qualified Lead):**
- Downloaded whitepaper
- Attended webinar
- Filled out "contact me" form
- Signal: Interested in learning

**PQL (Product-Qualified Lead):**
- Used product significantly
- Hit usage thresholds
- Shows expansion signals
- Signal: Experiencing value

**Why PQLs are better:** They've proven intent through action, not just declared interest.

---

## Defining Your PQL Criteria

### Step 1: Identify valuable behaviors
Behaviors that correlate with conversion/expansion:
- Activated (reached Aha moment)
- Used core feature X times
- Added Y team members
- Connected Z integrations
- Exceeded usage threshold
- Visited pricing page while active

### Step 2: Score behaviors

| Behavior | Points | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activated | 20 | Experienced value |
| 5+ team members | 30 | Team adoption |
| High feature usage | 25 | Power user signals |
| Pricing page visit | 15 | Purchase intent |
| Enterprise domain | 20 | High-value account |

**PQL Threshold:** 50+ points

### Step 3: Validate with data
Test your PQL definition:
- What % of PQLs convert to paid?
- What's their ACV vs non-PQLs?
- Is sales capacity well-utilized?

**Goal:**
- PQL conversion rate > 20%
- PQL ACV > 2x average

---

## When to Add Sales Touch

### The Trigger Framework

```
SALES TOUCH TRIGGERS

USAGE TRIGGERS:
- Exceeded plan limits
- High engagement velocity
- Team growth accelerating
- Enterprise features used

INTENT TRIGGERS:
- Visited pricing multiple times
- Started upgrade flow, didn't complete
- Asked about enterprise features
- Requested invoice/procurement info

ACCOUNT TRIGGERS:
- Enterprise domain (Fortune 500)
- Target account list match
- Multiple users from same company
- Industry/vertical fit
```

---

## The Right Touch for Each Segment

```
                      ACCOUNT VALUE
                   Low            High
              +--------------+--------------+
High          | Self-Serve   | Sales-Assist |
PRODUCT       | Nurture      | (Outbound)   |
ENGAGEMENT    +--------------+--------------+
Low           | Automated    | Sales-Led    |
              | (Re-engage)  | (Inbound)    |
              +--------------+--------------+
```

- **Self-Serve:** Let product do the work
- **Sales-Assist:** Sales enhances, doesn't replace product
- **Sales-Led:** Sales drives, product supports

---

## The Handoff: Product to Sales

### What Sales Needs to Know

**Account info:**
- Company name, size, industry
- Number of users from this domain
- Account value estimate

**Product usage:**
- When they signed up
- What features they've used
- How often they use the product
- What triggered PQL status

**Intent signals:**
- Pricing page views
- Feature requests
- Support interactions
- Upgrade attempts

**Recommended approach:**
- What problem are they likely solving?
- What pain points might they have?
- What expansion opportunity exists?

---

## Timing the Outreach

**Too early:**
"Hi, I see you signed up yesterday, want to buy?" -> Feels pushy, user hasn't experienced value

**Too late:**
"Hi, I see you've been using us for 6 months..." -> Missed the moment, user is settled in

**Just right:**
"Hi, I noticed your team has been getting great results with [feature]. Companies like yours often find value in [upgraded capability]. Want to explore?" -> Contextual, value-based, well-timed

---

## Sales + Product Collaboration

### Shared Metrics

```
HYBRID METRICS

PRODUCT TEAM OWNS:
- Signup volume
- Activation rate
- PQL generation rate
- Self-serve conversion rate

SALES TEAM OWNS:
- PQL -> Opportunity rate
- Opportunity -> Closed Won rate
- Average deal size
- Sales cycle length

SHARED:
- Total revenue
- Net revenue retention
- Customer lifetime value
```

### Feedback Loops

**Product -> Sales:**
- "These users are most likely to convert"
- "This feature usage predicts expansion"
- "This segment responds well to outreach"

**Sales -> Product:**
- "Users ask for this feature before buying"
- "This objection comes up repeatedly"
- "This use case needs better support"

**Continuous improvement:**
- Weekly PQL review meetings
- Monthly conversion analysis
- Quarterly strategy alignment

---

## Building the Hybrid Motion

### Phase 1: PLG Foundation (0-6 months)
**Focus:**
- Nail self-serve activation
- Build PQL scoring model
- Identify high-value signals
- Track conversion by segment

**Sales role:** None or very light touch

### Phase 2: Experiment with Sales (6-12 months)
**Focus:**
- Test sales touch on top PQLs
- Measure lift vs self-serve
- Refine PQL criteria
- Build handoff process

**Sales role:** Small team, focused on best opportunities

### Phase 3: Scale Hybrid (12+ months)
**Focus:**
- Automate PQL routing
- Segment-specific playbooks
- Sales + Product tight loop
- Continuous optimization

**Sales role:** Scaled to opportunity volume

---

## Common Hybrid Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Sales Too Early
**Problem:** Adding sales before PLG motion works
**Symptom:** Low conversion, high CAC, frustrated sales
**Fix:** Prove self-serve conversion first, then add sales

### Mistake 2: Wrong PQL Definition
**Problem:** Sending wrong users to sales
**Symptom:** Low PQL conversion, wasted sales time
**Fix:** Validate PQL criteria correlate with conversion

### Mistake 3: Friction Between Teams
**Problem:** Product and sales not aligned
**Symptom:** Blame games, missed handoffs, poor customer experience
**Fix:** Shared metrics, regular sync, clear ownership

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Self-Serve
**Problem:** Over-investing in sales, neglecting PLG
**Symptom:** CAC creep, scaling challenges
**Fix:** Maintain self-serve path, use sales only for leverage

## Key Takeaways

- PLG first, sales second - build the self-serve motion before adding sales
- PQLs > MQLs - product usage is the best signal of intent
- Right touch, right user - not everyone needs sales, not everyone should self-serve
- Tight feedback loop - product and sales must collaborate
- Protect self-serve - sales should add value, not create dependency
