# Activation

**Core Principle:** Activation is the highest-leverage PLG metric. Fix it first.

**Framework:** Define the Aha moment, reduce time to value, remove friction.

---

## Activation Metrics (Primary)

| Metric | Definition | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activation Rate | % signup -> Aha | > 30% |
| Time to Value (TTV) | Median time to Aha | < X hours |
| Setup Completion | % who finish onboarding | > 50% |
| D1 Aha | % who activate day 1 | > 20% |

---

## Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Why Track |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Steps to Aha | # actions before Aha | Find friction |
| Drop-off by step | % who leave at each step | Find barriers |
| TTV by cohort | Median TTV over time | Track improvement |
| Activation by source | Rate by acquisition channel | Quality of traffic |

## Cohort View (Activation Rate)

```
         Day 0   Day 1   Day 3   Day 7   Day 14
Oct      12%     23%     31%     35%     37%
Nov      15%     28%     36%     41%     43%
Dec      18%     32%     42%     48%     51%  <- Improving!

## Activation Experiments

### High-Impact Experiments to Run

1. **Reduce signup fields**
   - Test: Remove 2 fields from signup
   - Measure: Signup rate, Activation rate, TTV

2. **Defer email verification**
   - Test: Allow limited access before verify
   - Measure: Activation rate before churn

3. **Default to best template**
   - Test: Pre-select highest-converting template
   - Measure: Setup completion, Activation rate

4. **Progress indicators**
   - Test: Show "3 steps to go"
   - Measure: Setup completion, Drop-off by step

5. **Personalized onboarding**
   - Test: Different flows for different user types
   - Measure: Activation rate by segment

## Common Activation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Wrong Aha Moment
**Symptom:** High activation, low retention
**Problem:** The action you're measuring isn't actually valuable
**Fix:** Validate Aha moment correlates with retention and revenue

### Mistake 2: Forcing Activation
**Symptom:** High activation, low engagement after
**Problem:** Users are "activated" but didn't actually experience value
**Fix:** Measure quality of activation, not just completion

### Mistake 3: One-Size-Fits-All
**Symptom:** Some segments activate well, others don't
**Problem:** Different users have different paths to value
**Fix:** Segment analysis, personalized onboarding

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Failed Activations
**Symptom:** Focus only on successful users
**Problem:** Missing insights from users who tried and failed
**Fix:** Exit surveys, session recordings of failed activations

## Key Takeaways

- Activation is the highest-leverage PLG metric - fix it first
- Find your real Aha moment - the behavior that causes retention
- Time to value matters - every hour of delay loses users
- Remove friction ruthlessly - question every step
- Measure quality, not just completion - activated users should retain

---

## Practice Exercise: Your Activation Audit

### Define your Aha moment
- What behavior separates retained from churned users?
- Is this validated with data?

### Map your current journey
- How many steps from signup to Aha?
- Where's the biggest drop-off?

### Calculate your TTV
- What's your median time to value?
- What % activate within 24 hours?

### Identify top 3 friction points
- What's unnecessary?
- What could be deferred?
- What could be defaulted?
