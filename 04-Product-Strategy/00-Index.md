# Module 4: Product Strategy

## 2-Minute Overview

This module transforms your PRDs and strategy docs from "good story, weak spine" to "compelling and rigorous." Based on Amazon's Working Backwards and Shaun Clowes' Outside-In Thinking, you'll learn to start with the problem, validate externally, and build docs that drive decisions.

**Your Feedback:** "Story is good, but the spine is weak"

**Your Goal:** Every doc has a clear problem, metrics, and guardrails

## Key Frameworks

### Amazon Working Backwards (Ian McAllister)

> "If you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem. Working backwards means truly starting with the customer problem, not the solution you want to build."

### Outside-In Thinking (Shaun Clowes)

> "Spend 80% of your time thinking about things going on outside the building—customer, market, competitor. If you let your calendar rule you, nothing good will happen."

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
1. Use Amazon's Working Backwards method (PR/FAQ)
2. Think outside-in (80% time outside building)
3. Write PRDs that solve problems, not describe features
4. Verify problems exist in the wild before building
5. Build docs with clear problem, metrics, and guardrails

---

## Module Structure

### 01-Working-Backwards.md

**Key Question:** What are competitors doing?

### 03-PRD-Quality.md
Write PRDs that solve problems. Problem paragraph first, then solution.

**Key Question:** Does this have a clear PROBLEM paragraph?

### 04-PLG-Fundamentals.md
Product-led growth fundamentals: when it works, how to assess fit, and how to run the PLG funnel.

**Key Question:** Can a user sign up, experience value, and pay without talking to a human?

## The PRD Quality Standard

Your PRD must answer:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PRD QUALITY CHECKLIST                                       │

## The 3 Core Questions

Before building anything, ask:
1. **What does the customer actually experience?**
2. **What are competitors doing?**
3. **Have I verified this problem exists in the wild?**

---

## Learning Path

### Week 1: Working Backwards
- Read Part 01
- Rewrite one PRD starting with problem paragraph
- Test: Can the problem stand alone?

### Week 2: Outside-In
- Read Part 02
- Do customer/competitor research for current project
- Add external validation to PRD

### Week 3: Quality Checklist
- Read Part 03
- Audit a recent PRD against checklist
- Revise to close gaps

---

## Practice Plan

### Week 1: Working Backwards
- **Daily:** Before any feature, write the press release
- **Practice:** Start with customer experience, then work backwards
- **Self-grade:** Did I start with the customer?

### Week 2: Outside-In Thinking
- **Daily:** Spend time outside the building (users, competitors, market)
- **Practice:** Research before building
- **Self-grade:** Did I verify the problem exists?

### Week 3: PRD Quality
- **Daily:** Write problem paragraph first
- **Practice:** Problem → Solution → Metrics
- **Self-grade:** Does my PRD solve a problem?

---

## Success Metrics

### You've Mastered This When:
- ✅ PRDs approved on first review
- ✅ No questions about metric definitions
- ✅ Stakeholders understand the problem before the solution
- ✅ External validation included by default
- ✅ Your PRDs get approved faster
- ✅ You catch problems before building
- ✅ You build features that actually solve problems
- ✅ Stakeholders trust your strategic thinking

### Warning Signs:
- ⚠️ "What problem are we solving?" gets asked
- ⚠️ Metrics section is vague or missing
- ⚠️ Scope creep because v1 wasn't clear
- ⚠️ No mention of competitors or customers

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with:** `01-Working-Backwards.md`
2. **Practice daily:** Write press release before building
3. **Self-grade:** After each PRD
4. **Review weekly:** What problems did you catch?
5. **Reference:** `../frameworks/question-bank.md` for Q13-Q17 (Strategy & PRD questions)
