# Module 3: Ownership & Execution

## 2-Minute Overview

This module transforms you from "waiting for permission" to "owning outcomes." Based on Ian McAllister's "Think Like an Owner" framework, you'll learn to make decisions autonomously, track metrics proactively, and build the execution discipline that earns trust.

**Your Feedback:** "You should always decide it on your own... permissionless for user flow"

**Your Goal:** Default to action, own your metrics week-over-week

---

**Core Principle:** "Permissionless execution"

Great PMs don't wait for permission. They make decisions, own outcomes, and verify their work.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
1. Make decisions without unnecessary escalation
2. Own metrics end-to-end
3. Verify your work is live and working
4. Build trust through consistent execution

## Key Framework: Think Like an Owner

From Ian McAllister:

> "Think like an owner. Think beyond just your one little bubble, think about the broader business outside of the one little product you might be working on."

### The Ownership Mindset Shift

```
FROM: "Should I make this decision?"
TO:   "What decision would the CEO of this metric make?"

FROM: "I'll check the metrics when asked"
TO:   "I track my metrics every Monday and surface insights"

FROM: "Let me verify with stakeholders first"
TO:   "I'll decide and inform, unless it's truly irreversible"
```

### 02-Metric-Ownership.md
Own metrics end-to-end. What would you do as CEO of this metric?

**Key Question:** What would I do as CEO of this metric?

### 03-Verification-Habits.md

## Practice Plan

### Week 1: Permissionless Execution
- **Daily:** Before asking for permission, ask: "Can I do this without asking?"
- **Practice:** Make decisions and document them
- **Self-grade:** Did I wait unnecessarily?

### Week 2: Metric Ownership
- **Daily:** For each metric you own, ask: "What would I do as CEO?"
- **Practice:** Take full ownership of outcomes
- **Self-grade:** Did I own the outcome?

### Week 3: Verification Habits
- **Daily:** After any launch or change, verify it's live
- **Practice:** Check experiments are running
- **Self-grade:** Did I verify?

---

## Learning Path

- Audit your decisions: What am I unnecessarily escalating?
- Make 3 decisions without asking

### Week 2: Metric Ownership

- Read Part 02
- Establish weekly check for your key metrics
- Post one proactive update

### Ongoing: Verification

- Read Part 03
- Build the habit of verifying, not assuming
- Check experiments before calling them done
