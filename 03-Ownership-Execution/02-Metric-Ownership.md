# Metric Ownership

**Core Principle:** Own metrics end-to-end. What would you do as CEO of this metric?

---

## The Problem

PMs often "own" metrics but don't actually own them:
- They report on metrics but don't drive them
- They wait for others to fix problems
- They don't take full responsibility for outcomes

**Bad Pattern:**
> "The metric is down. Engineering needs to fix it."

**Good Pattern:**
> "The metric is down. Here's what I'm doing to fix it: [actions]. I'm working with engineering on [specific items]."

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Define Ownership
For each metric you "own," ask:
- What does ownership really mean?
- What am I responsible for?
- What can I control vs influence?

### Step 2: The CEO Test
Ask yourself:
- What would I do as CEO of this metric?
- What actions would I take?
- What decisions would I make?

### Step 3: Take Action
Based on the CEO test:
- What can I do directly?
- What can I influence?
- What do I need from others?

### Step 4: Own the Outcome
- Take full responsibility
- Drive actions end-to-end
- Report on progress
- Learn from results

## Examples

### Example 1: Conversion Metric

**Bad Ownership:**
> "Conversion is down. Engineering needs to fix the checkout flow."

**Good Ownership:**
> "Conversion is down 5%. As owner of this metric, here's what I'm doing:
> - Investigating root cause (data analysis)
> - Working with engineering on checkout flow fixes
> - Testing alternative approaches
> - Reporting weekly on progress
> 
> I own the outcome, and I'm driving actions to fix it."

---

### Example 2: Retention Metric

**Bad Ownership:**
> "Retention is stable. No action needed."

**Good Ownership:**
> "Retention is stable at 40%, but our target is 50%. As owner of this metric, here's what I'm doing:
> - Analyzing cohorts to find improvement opportunities
> - Testing onboarding improvements
> - Working with product on feature adoption
> - Setting up weekly dashboard to track progress
> 
> I own driving this to 50%."

---

### Example 3: Feature Adoption Metric

**Bad Ownership:**
> "Feature adoption is 15%. Users need to discover it better."

**Good Ownership:**
> "Feature adoption is 15%, target is 25%. As owner of this metric, here's what I'm doing:
> - Improving discoverability (onboarding, prompts)
> - Testing different messaging
> - Analyzing which users adopt and why
> - Iterating based on feedback
> 
> I own getting this to 25%."

## Practice Questions

For each metric you own, ask:
- [ ] What would I do as CEO of this metric?
- [ ] What actions can I take directly?
- [ ] What can I influence?
- [ ] Am I owning the outcome?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Reporting Without Owning
**Problem:** Reporting on metrics but not driving them.
**Fix:** Use the CEO test. What would you do as CEO?

### Mistake 2: Blaming Others
**Problem:** "Engineering needs to fix this" or "Users need to..."
**Fix:** Own the outcome. Drive actions. Work with others.

### Mistake 3: Passive Ownership
**Problem:** "I own this metric" but no actions.
**Fix:** Take action. Drive improvements. Report on progress.

### Mistake 4: Not Tracking Progress
**Problem:** Owning metrics but not tracking progress.
**Fix:** Set up weekly dashboards. Report on progress. Learn from results.

## The CEO Test

**Question:** What would I do as CEO of this metric?

**Think:**
- What actions would I take?
- What decisions would I make?
- What resources would I allocate?
- How would I measure progress?

**Then:**
- Take those actions (within your scope)
- Make those decisions (permissionless execution)
- Allocate resources (work with others)
- Measure progress (weekly dashboards)

---

## Building the Habit

### Week 1: Awareness
- For each metric you own, ask: "What would I do as CEO?"
- Note when you're reporting without owning
- Catch yourself and take action

### Week 2: Practice
- Force yourself to take one action per metric per week
- Document your actions
- Self-grade: Did I own the outcome?

### Week 3: Refinement
- Make it automatic
- Build weekly dashboard habits
- Continue self-grading

---

## Weekly Dashboard Template

For each metric you own, track:

**Metric:** [Name]
**Current Value:** [Value]
**Target:** [Target]
**Gap:** [Current vs Target]
**Actions This Week:** [What did you do?]
**Results:** [What happened?]
**Actions Next Week:** [What will you do?]
**Owner:** [You]

---

## Advanced: End-to-End Ownership

True ownership means:
- **Defining:** What's the metric? What's the target?
- **Measuring:** How do we track it? What's the baseline?
- **Analyzing:** What's driving it? What's the root cause?
- **Acting:** What are we doing? What's the plan?
- **Learning:** What worked? What didn't? What's next?

## Next Steps

1. **Practice today:** For one metric, ask: "What would I do as CEO?"
2. **Take action:** Do one thing to improve that metric
3. **Move to:** `03-Verification-Habits.md` to verify your work

## Your Real Examples

> Based on actual feedback: "Not seen as an 'owner' until you track the metric week over week"

### Example: Tracking Retention Ownership

**The Situation:**
You're assigned as the owner of merchant retention metrics

**What Happened (Before):**
> - Checked retention when asked in a meeting
> - Pulled data when preparing for a review
> - Didn't know the current number without looking

**The Feedback:**
> "Not seen as an 'owner' until you track the metric week over week"

**What to Do Instead (After):**

**Weekly Ritual (Every Monday):**
1. Check retention dashboard before standup
2. Know this week's number vs last week
3. Know the trend for the past 4 weeks
4. Have one hypothesis for any variance
5. Post update in #retention-metrics channel

**Example Weekly Update:**
> "📊 Retention Weekly Update (Jan 15)
> - D7 retention: 65% (vs 63% last week, +2pts)
> - D30 retention: 42% (vs 41% last week, +1pt)
> - Trend: Up 3 of last 4 weeks
> - Driver: Onboarding tooltip experiment showing positive signal
> - Watch: Paid cohort retention still 10pts below organic"

### Example: Monthly Sanity Scan

**The Situation:**
You've been tracking activation weekly, but haven't zoomed out

**What Happened (Before):**
> Weekly tracking, but missed that Q1 target was changed from 45% to 50% in leadership planning.

**The Feedback:**
> "Catch misalignment early on your own when leadership priorities change"

**What to Do Instead (After):**

**Monthly Sanity Scan (First Monday of Month):**
1. Re-read the Q-level goals doc
2. Check if your metric targets still match leadership expectations
3. Check if your metric definition still aligns with how leadership talks about it
4. Flag any misalignment immediately

**Example:**
> "⚠️ Heads up: I noticed the Q1 planning doc now shows 50% activation target (was 45%). I've updated my tracking and we're 18pts below the new target instead of 13pts. Here's my revised plan to close the gap..."

### The "Own Without Asking" Test

Answer these questions for your primary metric (without looking at a dashboard):

1. **What's the current value?** → If you don't know within 5%, you don't own it
2. **What was it last week?** → If you can't recall, you're not tracking weekly
3. **What's driving the trend?** → If you can't explain variance, you're reporting not owning
4. **What are you doing about it?** → If no actions, you're monitoring not owning

**Score yourself:**
- 4/4 = True ownership
- 2-3/4 = Tracking but not owning
- 0-1/4 = Not owning (yet)

---

### Weekly Dashboard Habit

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Monday AM | Pull metric, compare to last week, post update |
| Wednesday | Check if any experiments/changes affected metric |
| Friday | Prep for weekend—any anomalies to watch? |

**Time commitment:** 10 minutes/day = ownership credibility

---

**Remember:** Ownership isn't reporting. Ownership is driving outcomes.
