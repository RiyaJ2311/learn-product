# Permissionless Execution

**Core Principle:** Decide without asking. Can you post this publicly without asking? If yes, do it.

---

## The Problem

PMs often wait for permission unnecessarily. This slows down execution and signals lack of ownership.

**Bad Pattern:**
> "Should I send this email?" "Can I update this doc?" "Is it okay to post this?"

**Good Pattern:**
> Make the decision. Document it. Move forward.

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Ask the Question
Before asking for permission, ask yourself:
- Can I do this without asking?
- Is this within my scope?
- Will this cause harm if I'm wrong?

### Step 2: The Public Test
If you're unsure, ask:
- Can I post this publicly without asking?
- Would I be comfortable explaining this decision?
- Is this reversible?

### Step 3: Make the Decision
If the answer is yes:
- Do it
- Document it
- Move forward

If the answer is no:
- Escalate appropriately
- Provide context and recommendation
- Make it easy to decide

## Examples

### Example 1: Communication

**Bad:**
> "Should I send this update to the team?"

**Good:**
> Send the update. It's factual, within your scope, and helpful.

**Test:** Can you post this publicly? If yes, send it.

---

### Example 2: Documentation

**Bad:**
> "Can I update this PRD?"

**Good:**
> Update the PRD. It's your document, and the changes are improvements.

**Test:** Can you post this publicly? If yes, update it.

---

### Example 3: Decision

**Bad:**
> "Should we pause this experiment?"

**Good:**
> "I'm pausing this experiment. Here's why: [reasons]. Let me know if you disagree."

**Test:** Can you post this publicly? If yes, make the decision.

---

## When to Escalate

Escalate when:
- **Irreversible:** Decision can't be undone
- **High risk:** Could cause significant harm
- **Outside scope:** Not your decision to make
- **Strategic:** Affects company strategy

Don't escalate when:
- **Reversible:** Can be undone easily
- **Low risk:** Minimal downside
- **Within scope:** Your decision to make
- **Tactical:** Operational decision

## Practice Questions

Before asking for permission, ask:
- [ ] Can I do this without asking?
- [ ] Can I post this publicly without asking?
- [ ] Is this reversible?
- [ ] Am I waiting unnecessarily?

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Escalating Everything
**Problem:** Asking for permission on everything.
**Fix:** Use the public test. If you can post it publicly, do it.

### Mistake 2: Never Escalating
**Problem:** Making decisions you shouldn't make.
**Fix:** Escalate when it's irreversible, high risk, or outside scope.

### Mistake 3: Vague Escalation
**Problem:** "What should I do?" without context.
**Fix:** Provide context, recommendation, and make it easy to decide.

### Mistake 4: Not Documenting
**Problem:** Making decisions but not documenting them.
**Fix:** Document decisions so others understand context.

---

## The Public Test

**Question:** Can I post this publicly without asking?

**If Yes:**
- Do it
- Document it
- Move forward

**If No:**
- Escalate appropriately
- Provide context
- Make recommendation

## Building the Habit

### Week 1: Awareness
- Before asking for permission, ask: "Can I do this without asking?"
- Note when you're about to ask unnecessarily
- Catch yourself and use the public test

### Week 2: Practice
- Force yourself to make one decision per day without asking
- Document your decisions
- Self-grade: Did I wait unnecessarily?

### Week 3: Refinement
- Make it automatic
- Build confidence in your judgment
- Continue self-grading

---

## Decision Documentation Template

When you make a permissionless decision, document:

**Decision:** [What did you decide?]
**Date:** [When?]
**Context:** [Why did you decide this?]
**Rationale:** [What was your reasoning?]
**Reversible:** [Yes/No - can this be undone?]
**Escalated:** [Yes/No - did you escalate?]

## Advanced: Building Trust Through Permissionless Execution

When you consistently make good decisions without asking:
- Stakeholders trust your judgment
- You move faster
- You own outcomes
- You build influence

**Key:** Make good decisions. Document them. Learn from mistakes.

## Next Steps

1. **Practice today:** Make one decision without asking
2. **Self-grade:** After each decision
3. **Move to:** `02-Metric-Ownership.md` to own outcomes

## Your Real Examples

> Based on actual feedback: "You should always decide it on your own... permissionless for user flow"

### Example: User Flow Decisions

**The Situation:**
Deciding on the onboarding flow for the activation feature

**What Happened (Before):**
> "I've been thinking about the user flow for the first-send experience. I have a few options. Should I show a modal or an inline prompt? What do you think we should do?"

**What to Do Instead (After):**
> "I'm going with inline prompts for the first-send flow. Here's why: modal tests showed 20% lower completion in similar contexts, and our brand guidelines prefer less intrusive patterns. If data shows otherwise after launch, we can iterate. Let me know if you see a risk I'm missing."

**Key Takeaway:** User flow decisions are your domain. Make the call, explain the reasoning, ship it.

---

### Example: Hesitating to Post Publicly

**The Situation:**
Sharing experiment results in the team Slack channel

**What Happened (Before):**
> (DM to manager) "I have the experiment results. Should I post them in the channel? I want to make sure it's okay first."

**The Feedback:**
> "Waits for validation before acting; hesitates to post publicly"

**What to Do Instead (After):**
> (Posts directly in #product-updates)
> "🧪 Experiment Results: Onboarding Tooltip
> - Variant: +12% profile completion
> - Control: baseline
> - Recommendation: Ship to 100%
> - Timeline: Rolling out this week unless objections by EOD Thursday"

**Key Takeaway:** If the information is factual and helpful, post it. Don't ask for permission to share updates.

### The Permission Audit

Ask yourself daily:
- **What am I waiting on?** List 3 things you're blocked on
- **For each:** Is this a real blocker, or am I waiting unnecessarily?
- **Action:** Make the call on 1-2 items you don't actually need permission for

**Common "fake blockers":**
- Waiting for approval to update a doc you own
- Waiting for feedback to ship a low-risk experiment
- Waiting for validation to share data with the team
- Waiting for alignment before making UX copy changes

### Permissionless ≠ Reckless

| Permissionless (Good) | Reckless (Bad) |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Ship onboarding flow variant | Ship pricing change without finance |
| Post experiment results publicly | Share confidential data in public channel |
| Update PRD with new learnings | Change PRD scope without stakeholder heads-up |
| Send weekly update to team | Send update to exec team without manager context |

**Rule of thumb:** If it's within your scope, reversible, and low-risk → do it. If it's outside scope, irreversible, or high-risk → escalate with a recommendation.

---

**Remember:** Permissionless execution builds trust. Trust enables impact.
