# Impact Selling

**Core Principle:** Make wins stick. Repeat your wins enough times that they become part of the narrative.

---

## The Problem

PMs often achieve wins but don't make them stick. They mention them once and assume stakeholders remember. This leads to:
- Wins being forgotten
- Impact not being recognized
- Lack of credit for your work

**Bad Pattern:**
> "We improved engagement by 20%." [Mentioned once, then forgotten]

**Good Pattern:**
> "We improved engagement by 20%." [Repeated in multiple contexts until it sticks]

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Win
What's the win?
- What did you achieve?
- What's the impact?
- Why does this matter?

### Step 2: Repeat Strategically
Don't repeat randomly. Repeat strategically:
- In relevant meetings
- In status updates
- In reviews
- In conversations

**Key:** Repeat in contexts where it matters.

### Step 3: Make It Stick
Repeat enough times that it becomes part of the narrative:
- First mention: Introduce the win
- Second mention: Reinforce the win
- Third mention: Make it part of the story
- Fourth+ mention: It's now part of the narrative

**Key:** Repetition builds memory.

### Step 4: Connect to Impact
Always connect wins to impact:
- What problem did this solve?
- What's the business impact?
- Why does this matter?

**Key:** Impact makes wins memorable.

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Launch Win

**Win:** "We launched feature X, which increased engagement by 20%."

**Repetition Strategy:**
- **Week 1:** "We launched feature X. Early results show 20% engagement increase."
- **Week 2:** "Feature X is performing well. We're seeing 20% engagement increase."
- **Week 3:** "Feature X continues to drive results. 20% engagement increase."
- **Week 4:** "Feature X has been a success. 20% engagement increase."

**Result:** Win becomes part of the narrative.

---

### Example 2: Metric Improvement Win

**Win:** "We improved retention from 40% to 50%."

**Repetition Strategy:**
- **Status Update:** "We improved retention from 40% to 50%."
- **Review Meeting:** "One of our key wins: retention improved from 40% to 50%."
- **Stakeholder Update:** "Retention improvement: 40% to 50%."
- **Quarterly Review:** "This quarter, we improved retention from 40% to 50%."

**Result:** Win becomes part of the narrative.

---

### Example 3: Problem-Solving Win

**Win:** "We solved the checkout problem, which increased conversion by 15%."

**Repetition Strategy:**
- **Problem-Solving Context:** "We solved the checkout problem. Conversion increased 15%."
- **Impact Context:** "Our checkout improvements drove 15% conversion increase."
- **Success Story Context:** "One success: solving checkout problem, 15% conversion increase."
- **Narrative Context:** "We've been focused on conversion. Our checkout improvements drove 15% increase."

**Result:** Win becomes part of the narrative.

## Practice Questions

After achieving a win, ask:
- [ ] Have I repeated this win enough?
- [ ] Is this win part of the narrative?
- [ ] Did I connect the win to impact?
- [ ] Will stakeholders remember this win?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Mentioning Once
**Problem:** Mentioning wins once and assuming stakeholders remember.
**Fix:** Repeat wins strategically until they stick.

### Mistake 2: Not Connecting to Impact
**Problem:** "We did X" without explaining why it matters.
**Fix:** Always connect wins to impact.

### Mistake 3: Over-Repeating
**Problem:** Repeating wins too much, becoming annoying.
**Fix:** Repeat strategically, not constantly.

### Mistake 4: Not Adapting Message
**Problem:** Using the same message in all contexts.
**Fix:** Adapt the message to the context while keeping the core win.

---

## Repetition Strategy

### When to Repeat
- **Relevant Meetings:** When the win is relevant to the discussion
- **Status Updates:** Regular updates where wins fit naturally
- **Reviews:** Performance reviews, quarterly reviews
- **Conversations:** When the topic comes up naturally

### How to Repeat
- **First Mention:** Introduce the win clearly
- **Second Mention:** Reinforce the win with context
- **Third Mention:** Make it part of the story
- **Fourth+ Mention:** It's now part of the narrative

### What to Repeat
- **The Win:** What did you achieve?
- **The Impact:** Why does this matter?
- **The Context:** How does this fit into the bigger picture?

## Building the Habit

### Week 1: Awareness
- After achieving a win, ask: "Have I repeated this enough?"
- Note when you're mentioning wins only once
- Catch yourself and repeat strategically

### Week 2: Practice
- Force yourself to repeat wins in multiple contexts
- Connect wins to impact
- Self-grade: Have I repeated wins enough?

### Week 3: Refinement
- Make it automatic
- Build repetition into your communication
- Continue self-grading

---

## Win Tracking Template

**Win:** [What did you achieve?]
**Impact:** [Why does this matter?]
**Repetition Count:** [How many times have you mentioned it?]
**Contexts:** [Where have you mentioned it?]
**Stuck?** [Yes/No - Is it part of the narrative?]

---

## Advanced: Win Narrative Building

Build a narrative around your wins:

**Quarterly Narrative:**
- What were your key wins this quarter?
- How do they connect?
- What's the overall impact?

**Annual Narrative:**
- What were your key wins this year?
- How do they connect?
- What's your impact story?

**Then:** Repeat this narrative consistently.

## Next Steps

1. **Practice today:** After your next win, repeat it strategically
2. **Self-grade:** After each repetition
3. **Move to:** `03-Goal-Adaptability.md` to adapt goals appropriately

## Your Real Examples

> Based on actual feedback: "You move on from wins without making sure they stick in leadership's mind"

### Example: The Top Nav Win That Didn't Stick

**The Situation:**
You shipped a top nav improvement that increased feature discovery by 18%

**What Happened (Before):**
> - Shipped the feature ✓
> - Posted results in Slack once ✓
> - Moved on to the next project
> - Three months later: leadership doesn't remember this win

**The Feedback:**
> "Poor impact communication - work like top nav helped, but it didn't get repeated upward"

**What to Do Instead (After):**

**Week 1 (Ship):**
> - Post in #product-updates: "🚀 Top nav redesign shipped. Hypothesis: +10% feature discovery"

**Week 2 (Early Results):**
> - Post in #product-updates: "📊 Top nav update: +18% feature discovery (vs +10% target). Driven by clearer IA."

**Week 3 (Reinforce):**
> - In team standup: "Following up on top nav — we're seeing sustained +18% discovery. This is one of our biggest Q4 wins."

**Week 4 (Repeat Upward):**
> - In skip-level or leadership sync: "One highlight from Q4: our top nav redesign drove 18% more feature discovery. This helped retention in segment X."

**Monthly Review:**
> - In monthly product update: "Key wins: Top nav (+18% discovery), [other wins]..."

**Quarterly Review:**
> - In quarterly review: "One of our Q4 wins was the top nav redesign. +18% feature discovery, which correlates with 5% higher retention."

### The "Upward Repetition" Cadence

Most wins need 4-6 mentions before leadership remembers them:

| When | What | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| Day 1 | Ship announcement | Team Slack |
| Week 1 | Early results | Team Slack |
| Week 2 | Results confirmation | Manager 1:1 |
| Week 3 | Impact context | Team meeting |
| Week 4 | Upward share | Skip-level or leadership sync |
| Month 1 | Summary | Monthly product update |
| Quarter | Narrative | Quarterly review |

---

### Example: Translating to Leadership Language

**Win:** "Profile completion improved by 12%"

**Team Language:**
> "Profile completion is up 12%. Our tooltip experiment worked."

**Leadership Language:**
> "We improved activation funnel efficiency by 12%, which projects to 50 more activated merchants per month. At $45 ARPU, that's ~$2K additional MRR."

**Key Takeaway:** Leadership cares about business impact (revenue, retention, growth), not feature metrics. Always translate.

---

### The Win Log

Keep a running log of wins to ensure you repeat them:

```
| Win | Impact | Mentions | Last Mention | Status |
|-----|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Top nav redesign | +18% discovery | 3 | Jan 10 | Need to mention in quarterly |
| Onboarding tooltip | +12% activation | 2 | Jan 5 | Need to mention upward |
| First send wizard | TBD | 0 | - | Just shipped, start repetition |
```

**Weekly review:** Check each win. Has it been mentioned upward? Is it stuck yet?

---

### Anti-Pattern: The "Humble Achiever"

**Problem:** You ship good work but feel uncomfortable "bragging" about it.

**Reframe:** Impact selling isn't bragging. It's:
1. Giving leadership visibility into what's working
2. Building credibility for future investments
3. Helping the team get credit
4. Creating documentation for performance reviews

**If you don't sell your impact, no one will.**

**Remember:** Repetition builds memory. Memory builds recognition.
