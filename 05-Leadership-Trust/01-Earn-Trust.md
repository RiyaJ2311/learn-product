# Earn Trust

**Framework:** Ian McAllister's approach to building stakeholder trust

**Core Principle:** Trust is built through consistent execution, clear communication, and delivering on commitments.

---

## The Problem

PMs often struggle to build trust with stakeholders because:
- They don't communicate in stakeholder language
- They don't deliver consistently
- They don't make their impact clear

**Bad Pattern:**
> "We improved the feature. Here are the technical details..."

**Good Pattern:**
> "We improved the feature, which increased user engagement by 20%. This means we're retaining more users and driving more revenue. Here's what we did..."

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Understand Stakeholder Language
Different stakeholders speak different languages:
- **Executives:** Business outcomes, revenue, strategic alignment
- **Engineering:** Technical feasibility, complexity, trade-offs
- **Design:** User experience, usability, aesthetics
- **Sales:** Customer value, competitive advantage, market fit

**Key:** Translate your message to their language.

### Step 2: Sell Impact, Not Features
Don't sell features. Sell impact:
- What problem does this solve?
- What's the business impact?
- Why does this matter?

**Key:** Always connect features to impact.

### Step 3: Deliver Consistently
Trust is built through consistent execution:
- Deliver on commitments
- Communicate clearly
- Follow through

**Key:** Do what you say you'll do.

### Step 4: Make Impact Visible
Don't assume stakeholders see your impact:
- Communicate wins clearly
- Show progress regularly
- Make impact visible

**Key:** Make your impact impossible to miss.

## Examples

### Example 1: Executive Communication

**Bad:**
> "We improved the search feature. Here are the technical details..."

**Good:**
> "We improved search, which increased user engagement by 20%. This means we're retaining more users and driving more revenue. We're on track to hit our Q4 goals."

**Language:** Business outcomes, revenue, strategic alignment

---

### Example 2: Engineering Communication

**Bad:**
> "We need to build this feature. It's important."

**Good:**
> "We need to build this feature to solve [specific problem]. Here's the technical approach: [details]. The trade-offs are [X vs Y]. Estimated complexity: [low/medium/high]."

**Language:** Technical feasibility, complexity, trade-offs

---

### Example 3: Sales Communication

**Bad:**
> "We built a new feature. Here's how it works..."

**Good:**
> "We built a new feature that solves [customer problem]. This gives us a competitive advantage because [reason]. Customers are asking for this, and it's driving [outcome]."

**Language:** Customer value, competitive advantage, market fit

## Practice Questions

Before stakeholder interactions, ask:
- [ ] What language does this stakeholder speak?
- [ ] Did I translate impact to their language?
- [ ] Did I sell impact, not features?
- [ ] Did I make my impact visible?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: One-Size-Fits-All Communication
**Problem:** Using the same language for all stakeholders.
**Fix:** Adapt your language to each stakeholder.

### Mistake 2: Selling Features, Not Impact
**Problem:** "We built X" without explaining why it matters.
**Fix:** Always connect features to impact.

### Mistake 3: Not Delivering Consistently
**Problem:** Making commitments but not following through.
**Fix:** Only commit to what you can deliver. Deliver consistently.

### Mistake 4: Assuming Impact is Visible
**Problem:** Assuming stakeholders see your impact.
**Fix:** Make your impact visible. Communicate wins clearly.
