# Goal Adaptability

**Core Principle:** Pivot when metrics change. Don't stick to goals that no longer make sense.

---

## The Problem

PMs often stick to goals even when metrics change and the goals no longer make sense. This leads to:
- Chasing irrelevant metrics
- Missing better opportunities
- Wasting time on wrong priorities

**Bad Pattern:**
> "Our goal is to increase DAU by 20%. [Even though retention is dropping and revenue is declining]"

**Good Pattern:**
> "Our goal was to increase DAU by 20%, but retention is dropping and revenue is declining. We should pivot to focus on retention instead."

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Monitor Metrics Regularly
Don't set goals and forget them:
- Monitor metrics weekly
- Track progress toward goals
- Watch for changes in context

**Key:** Stay aware of what's happening.

### Step 2: Identify When Goals Don't Make Sense
Goals don't make sense when:
- **Metrics change:** The underlying metrics have changed significantly
- **Context changes:** The business context has changed
- **Better opportunities:** There are better opportunities to pursue
- **Goals are harmful:** Pursuing the goal is causing harm

**Key:** Recognize when goals need to change.

### Step 3: Pivot Appropriately
When goals don't make sense:
- Acknowledge the change
- Explain why the goal no longer makes sense
- Propose a new goal
- Get alignment on the pivot

**Key:** Pivot clearly and get alignment.

### Step 4: Communicate the Pivot
Don't pivot silently:
- Communicate why you're pivoting
- Explain the new goal
- Get stakeholder buy-in

**Key:** Make pivots visible and understood.

## Examples

### Example 1: Metric Change

**Original Goal:**
> "Increase DAU by 20% this quarter."

**Change:**
> Retention dropped from 50% to 40%. Revenue is declining.

**Pivot:**
> "Our goal was to increase DAU by 20%, but retention dropped from 50% to 40% and revenue is declining. We should pivot to focus on retention instead. New goal: Improve retention from 40% to 50%."

---

### Example 2: Context Change

**Original Goal:**
> "Launch feature X this quarter."

**Change:**
> Competitor launched a better version. Market shifted.

**Pivot:**
> "Our goal was to launch feature X, but competitor launched a better version and the market shifted. We should pivot to focus on feature Y instead, which addresses the new market need."

---

### Example 3: Better Opportunity

**Original Goal:**
> "Improve conversion by 5%."

**Change:**
> Found a bigger opportunity: retention improvement could drive 20% revenue increase.

**Pivot:**
> "Our goal was to improve conversion by 5%, but we found a bigger opportunity: retention improvement could drive 20% revenue increase. We should pivot to focus on retention instead."

## Practice Questions

When metrics change, ask:
- [ ] Does this goal still make sense?
- [ ] Should I adapt this goal?
- [ ] What's the new goal?
- [ ] Have I communicated the pivot?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Sticking to Goals Blindly
**Problem:** Sticking to goals even when they don't make sense.
**Fix:** Regularly evaluate if goals still make sense. Pivot when needed.

### Mistake 2: Pivoting Too Often
**Problem:** Pivoting goals constantly, creating confusion.
**Fix:** Pivot when metrics or context change significantly, not for minor fluctuations.

### Mistake 3: Not Communicating Pivots
**Problem:** Pivoting silently without explaining why.
**Fix:** Always communicate pivots clearly. Explain why and get alignment.

### Mistake 4: Not Getting Alignment
**Problem:** Pivoting without stakeholder buy-in.
**Fix:** Get alignment on pivots. Explain why and get agreement.

## When to Pivot

### Pivot When:
- **Metrics change significantly:** 20%+ change in key metrics
- **Context changes:** Business context has shifted
- **Better opportunities:** Found significantly better opportunities
- **Goals are harmful:** Pursuing goal is causing harm

### Don't Pivot When:
- **Minor fluctuations:** Small changes in metrics (5-10%)
- **Temporary changes:** Changes that are likely temporary
- **No better alternative:** No clear better alternative
- **Stakeholder alignment:** Stakeholders want to stick to goal

## Building the Habit

### Week 1: Awareness
- Monitor metrics weekly
- Ask: "Does this goal still make sense?"
- Note when you're sticking to goals that don't make sense

### Week 2: Practice
- Force yourself to evaluate goals regularly
- Pivot when metrics or context change
- Communicate pivots clearly
- Self-grade: Did I adapt appropriately?

### Week 3: Refinement
- Make it automatic
- Build goal evaluation into your process
- Continue self-grading

## Goal Evaluation Template

**Goal:** [What's the goal?]
**Current Progress:** [How are we doing?]
**Metrics:** [What are the key metrics?]
**Context:** [What's the business context?]
**Still Makes Sense?** [Yes/No]
**If No:** [Why? What's the new goal?]
**Pivot Plan:** [How will we pivot?]

---

## Advanced: Systematic Goal Management

Build systems for goal management:

**Weekly:**
- Review progress toward goals
- Monitor key metrics
- Evaluate if goals still make sense

**Monthly:**
- Comprehensive goal evaluation
- Identify pivots needed
- Communicate pivots

**Quarterly:**
- Set new goals
- Review past goals
- Learn from pivots

---

## Next Steps

1. **Practice today:** Evaluate one goal. Does it still make sense?
2. **Self-grade:** After each evaluation
3. **Review:** Combine with `01-Earn-Trust.md` and `02-Impact-Selling.md`

**Remember:** Goals are tools, not rules. Pivot when they no longer serve their purpose.
