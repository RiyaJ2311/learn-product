# Module 5: Leadership & Trust

## 2-Minute Overview

This module transforms you from "getting work done" to "being recognized for impact." Based on Ian McAllister's "Earn Trust" framework, you'll learn to build stakeholder relationships, communicate wins effectively, and adapt quickly when goals change.

**Your Feedback:** "You move on from wins without making sure they stick in leadership's mind"

**Your Goal:** Your impact is remembered and recognized

From Ian McAllister:

> "Trust is the currency of a product leader. If you don't build the support and relationships, the right strategy may not get executed. Even if it's the right thing, it may not land."
