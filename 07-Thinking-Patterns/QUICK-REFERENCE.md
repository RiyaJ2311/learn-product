## The 7 Core Questions

Before any significant decision, ask at least one:

| # | Question | Activates |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **"What would have to be true for this to work?"** | First Principles |
| 2 | **"How could this fail spectacularly?"** | Pre-Mortem |
| 3 | **"And then what happens?"** | Second-Order |
| 4 | **"What am I not seeing?"** | Bias Check |
| 5 | **"What's the bottleneck?"** | Systems |
| 6 | **"Is this reversible?"** | Decision Quality |
| 7 | **"Would I still do this if I hadn't started?"** | Sunk Cost Check |

## Bias Quick Check

Before important decisions, scan for:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BIAS QUICK SCAN                                             │

│                                                            │
│ □ CONFIRMATION: Am I only seeing what I want to see?       │
│                                                            │
│ □ SUNK COST: Would I do this if I hadn't started?          │
│                                                            │
│ □ AVAILABILITY: Is this memorable or representative?       │
│                                                            │
│ □ ANCHORING: Am I stuck on the first number I heard?       │
│                                                            │
│ □ OPTIMISM: Are my estimates realistic vs. base rates?     │
│                                                            │
│ □ BANDWAGON: Would I do this if no one else was?           │
│                                                            │

## Anti-Pattern Warning Signs

If you catch yourself saying these, pause:

## Systems Thinking Shortcuts

### The Leverage Hierarchy (Most to Least Powerful)

1. **Paradigms** - Change how people think
2. **Goals** - Change what system optimizes for
3. **Feedback loops** - Add/strengthen feedback
4. **Information flows** - Change who knows what
5. **Rules** - Change incentives/permissions
6. **Structure** - Change organization
7. **Parameters** - Change numbers (least leverage)

### Feedback Loop Types

- **Reinforcing** (↑↑) - Growth spirals, virtuous/vicious cycles
- **Balancing** (↑↓) - Stabilizing forces, natural limits

---

## Framework Selection Guide

| Situation | Use This Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| How much rigor to apply? | Reversibility Test |
| Stuck on a problem? | First Principles |
| About to launch? | Pre-Mortem |
| Making big decision? | Second-Order + Bias Check |
| Analyzing growth? | Systems Thinking |
| Multiple options? | Weighted Scoring |
| Feeling emotional? | 10/10/10 Rule |
| Team disagrees? | DACI + Disagree & Commit |

## Daily Practice

### Morning (1 min)
Pick one question as your lens for the day:
- Monday: "Did I answer the question first?"
- Tuesday: "What would have to be true?"
- Wednesday: "How could this fail?"
- Thursday: "And then what?"
- Friday: "What am I not seeing?"

### Before Decisions (30 sec)
1. Is this reversible?
2. Have I asked "And then what?"
3. What bias might be affecting me?

### End of Day (2 min)
- What decision did I make today?
- What thinking pattern did I use (or should have)?

---

## The Compound Effect

```
Week 1:  Learn the questions
Week 2:  Remember to ask them
Week 3:  Ask them more naturally
Week 4:  Start catching biases
Week 8:  Questions become habits
Week 12: Better decisions automatically
```

## Emergency Kit

### When you feel stuck:
→ First Principles: Break it down to fundamentals

### When you feel certain:
→ Pre-Mortem: How could this fail?

### When others pressure you:
→ Reversibility: How bad is getting it wrong?

### When data seems clear:
→ Bias Check: What am I not seeing?

### When you've invested a lot:
→ Sunk Cost: Would I start this fresh today?

**Remember:** Thinking patterns are tools, not rules. Use the right tool for the situation.
