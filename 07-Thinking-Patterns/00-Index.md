# Module 7: Mental Models & Thinking Patterns

## 2-Minute Overview

The best PMs don't just execute well—they **think differently**. This module teaches you the mental models that separate good PMs from great ones. These are the invisible frameworks that shape how top product leaders make decisions, solve problems, and navigate ambiguity.

**Your Context:** Most PM advice focuses on *what* to do. This module focuses on *how to think*.

**Your Goal:** Build a toolkit of mental models you can deploy automatically in any situation.

## Why Thinking Patterns Matter

From Charlie Munger (Berkshire Hathaway):

> "You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models."

**The PM Reality:**
- You face novel problems daily that don't have playbooks
- You make 50+ decisions per week with incomplete information
- You navigate competing priorities from multiple stakeholders
- You must think clearly under pressure and ambiguity

**Mental models are your cognitive shortcuts.** They help you recognize patterns, avoid common traps, and make better decisions faster.

## Quick Reference: Core Mental Models

### For Problem-Solving
- **First Principles:** Break down to fundamental truths, rebuild from there
- **Inversion:** Start with what you want to avoid, work backwards
- **5 Whys:** Keep asking "why" to find root cause

### For Decision-Making
- **Second-Order Thinking:** "And then what?" Consider consequences of consequences
- **Regret Minimization:** Which choice minimizes future regret?
- **Reversibility Test:** How easy is this to undo?

### For Systems
- **Feedback Loops:** Where are reinforcing/balancing loops?
- **Bottlenecks:** What's the constraint limiting the whole system?
- **Leverage Points:** Small changes with big effects

### For Avoiding Traps
- **Confirmation Bias:** Am I only seeing what I want to see?
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Am I continuing because I've already invested?
- **Survivorship Bias:** Am I only learning from successes?

## The 7 Thinking Questions

Use these questions to activate better thinking:

| # | Question | Mental Model |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "What would have to be true for this to work?" | First Principles |
| 2 | "How could this fail spectacularly?" | Pre-Mortem / Inversion |
| 3 | "And then what happens?" | Second-Order Thinking |
| 4 | "What am I not seeing?" | Bias Awareness |
| 5 | "What's the bottleneck?" | Systems Thinking |
| 6 | "Is this reversible?" | Decision Framework |
| 7 | "Would I still do this if I hadn't started?" | Sunk Cost Check |

---

## Daily Practice

### Before Making Any Decision
Ask: "What mental model applies here?"

Common triggers:
- "We should do X because everyone does it" → First Principles
- "We've always done it this way" → Inversion
- "This will definitely work" → Pre-Mortem
- "Let's just ship and see" → Second-Order Thinking
- "The data proves X" → Bias Check

### Weekly Reflection
Add to your Friday reflection:
- What decision did I make this week?
- What mental model did I use (or should have used)?
- What bias might have affected my thinking?

## Success Metrics

### You've Mastered This When:

- You naturally ask "and then what?" before decisions
- You catch yourself falling into biases and correct course
- You can break down complex problems to first principles
- You run mental pre-mortems before major launches
- Your decisions account for second-order effects

### Warning Signs:

- Making the same mistakes repeatedly
- Decisions feel reactive, not proactive
- You're surprised by outcomes you should have predicted
- You defend past decisions even when evidence says pivot
- You optimize for local maxima, missing systemic issues

---
